**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21716](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21716)

**Abstract**:

Cloud Causality Analyzer (CCA) is an ML-based analytical pipeline to automate the tedious process of Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of Cloud IT events. The 3-stage pipeline is composed of 9 functional modules, including dimensionality reduction (feature engineering, selection and compression), embedded anomaly detection, and an ensemble of 3 custom explainability and causality models for Cloud Key Performance Indicators (KPI). Our challenge is: How to apply a reduced (sub)set of judiciously selected KPIs to detect Cloud performance anomalies, and their respective root causal culprits, all without compromising accuracy?

**Authors**: *Maurício Gruppi, Sibel Adali, Pin-Yu Chen*

**Conference**: *aaai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21717](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21717)

**Abstract**:

Lexical Semantic Change (LSC) detection, also known as Semantic Shift, is the process of identifying and characterizing variations in language usage across different scenarios such as time and domain. It allows us to track the evolution of word senses, as well as to understand the difference between the language used in distinct communities. LSC detection is often done by applying a distance measure over vectors of two aligned word embedding matrices. In this demonstration, we present SenSE, an interactive semantic shift exploration toolkit that provides visualization and explanation of lexical semantic change for an input pair of text sources. Our system focuses on showing how the different alignment strategies may affect the output of an LSC model as well as on explaining semantic change based on the neighbors of a chosen target word, while also extracting examples of sentences where these semantic deviations appear. The system runs as a web application (available at http://sense.mgruppi.me), allowing the audience to interact by configuring the alignment strategies while visualizing the results in a web browser.

**Abstract**:

As countries enter the endemic phase of COVID-19, people's risk of exposure to the virus is greater than ever. There is a need to make more informed decisions in our daily lives on avoiding crowded places. Crowd monitoring systems typically require costly infrastructure. We propose a crowd-sourced crowd monitoring platform which leverages user inputs to generate crowd counts and forecast location crowdedness. A key challenge for crowd-sourcing is a lack of incentive for users to contribute. We propose a Reinforcement Learning based dynamic incentive mechanism to optimally allocate rewards to encourage user participation.

**Authors**: *Yoonseok Hong, Shounan An, Sunwoo Im, Jaegeon Jo, Insoo Oh*

**Conference**: *aaai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21719](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21719)

**Abstract**:

In this paper, we propose on-device voice command assistants for mobile games to increase user experiences even in hands-busy situations such as driving and cooking. Since most of the current mobile games cost large memory (e.g. more than 1GB memory), so it is necessary to reduce memory usage further to integrate voice commands systems on mobile clients. Therefore a need to design an on-device automatic speech recognition system that costs minimal memory and CPU resources rises. To this end, we apply cross layer parameter sharing to Conformer, named MONICA2 which results in lower memory usage for on-device speech recognition. MONICA2 reduces the number of parameters of deep neural network by 58%, with minimal recognition accuracy degradation measured in word error rate on Librispeech benchmark. As an on-device voice command user interface, MONICA2 costs only 12.8MB mobile memory and the average inference time for 3-seconds voice command is about 30ms, which is profiled in Samsung Galaxy S9. As far as we know, MONICA2 is the most memory efficient yet accurate on-device speech recognition which could be applied to various applications such as mobile games, IoT devices, etc.

**Abstract**:

Evaluating interactive AI (IAI) systems is a challenging task, as their output highly depends on the performed user actions. As a result, developers often depend on limited and mostly qualitative data derived from user testing to improve their systems. In this paper, we present InteractEva; a systematic evaluation framework for IAI systems. InteractEva employs (a) a user simulation backend to test the system against different use cases and user interactions at scale with (b) an interactive frontend allowing developers to perform important quantitative evaluation tasks, including acquiring a performance overview, performing error analysis, and conducting what-if studies. The framework has supported the evaluation and improvement of an industrial IAI text extraction system, results of which will be presented during our demonstration.

**Abstract**:

While Math Word Problem (MWP) solving has emerged as a popular field of study and made great progress in recent years, most existing methods are benchmarked solely on one or two datasets and implemented with different configurations. In this paper, we introduce the first open-source library for solving MWPs called MWPToolkit, which provides a unified, comprehensive, and extensible framework for the research purpose. Specifically, we deploy 17 deep learning-based MWP solvers and 6 MWP datasets in our toolkit. These MWP solvers are advanced models for MWP solving, covering the categories of Seq2seq, Seq2Tree, Graph2Tree, and Pre-trained Language Models. And these MWP datasets are popular datasets that are commonly used as benchmarks in existing work. Our toolkit is featured with highly modularized and reusable components, which can help researchers quickly get started and develop their own models. We have released the code and documentation of MWPToolkit in https://github.com/LYH-YF/MWPToolkit.

## [1609] Silence or Outbreak - a Real-Time Emergent Topic Identification System (RealTIS) for Social Media

**Authors**: *Ning Lu, Zhen Yang, Jian Huang, Yaxi Wu, Hesong Wang*

**Conference**: *aaai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21725](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21725)

**Abstract**:

This paper presents RealTIS, a Real-time emergent Topic Identification System for user-generated content on the web via social networking services such as Twitter, Weibo, and Facebook. Without user intervention, our proposed RealTIS system can efficiently collect necessary social media posts, construct a quality topic summarization from the vast sea of data, and then automatically identify whether the emerging topics will be out-breaking or just fading into silence. RealTIS uses a time-sliding window to compute the statistics about the basic structure (motifs) variation of the propagation network for a specific topic. These statistics are then used to predict unusual shifts in correlations, make early warning and detect outbreak. Besides, this work also illustrates the mechanism by which our proposed system makes early warning happen.

## [1610] SWWS: A Smart Wildlife Warning Sign System

**Authors**: *Alan Ma*

**Conference**: *aaai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21726](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21726)

**Abstract**:

Every year in the US, millions of animals are run over by vehicles making wildlife vehicle collisions a real danger to both animals and human. In addition, road networks be-come abiotic barriers to wildlife migration between regions creating ripple effects on ecosystems. In this paper, a smart wildlife warning sign system (SWWS) is demonstrated, utilizing the technologies of Internet of Things, image recognition, data processing and visualization. This smart sign system is intended to prevent roadkill by warning drivers to slow down once sensors are triggered and simultaneously capture animal images via infrared cam-era. Data collection is conducted through local neural network model identification of wildlife images and saved along with metadata based on animal activity occurrence. Wildlife activity data can be exported wirelessly to cloud database to assist ecologists and government road agencies to investigate and analyze the wildlife activity and migration patterns over time.

## [1611] An End-to-End Traditional Chinese Medicine Constitution Assessment System Based on Multimodal Clinical Feature Representation and Fusion

**Authors**: *Huisheng Mao, Baozheng Zhang, Hua Xu, Kai Gao*

**Conference**: *aaai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21727](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v36i11.21727)

**Abstract**:

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) constitution is a fundamental concept in TCM theory. It is determined by multimodal TCM clinical features which, in turn, are obtained from TCM clinical information of image (face, tongue, etc.), audio (pulse and voice), and text (inquiry) modality.
The auto assessment of TCM constitution is faced with two major challenges: (1) learning discriminative TCM clinical feature representations; (2) jointly processing the features using multimodal fusion techniques. The TCM Constitution Assessment System (TCM-CAS) is proposed to provide an end-to-end solution to this task, along with auxiliary functions to aid TCM researchers. To improve the results of TCM constitution prediction, the system combines multiple machine learning algorithms such as facial landmark detection, image segmentation, graph neural networks and multimodal fusion.
Extensive experiments are conducted on a four-category multimodal TCM constitution dataset, and the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Provided with datasets containing annotations of diseases, the system can also perform automatic disease diagnosis from a TCM perspective.

**Abstract**:

We present a demonstration of the interactive task learning agent Rosie, where it learns the task of patrolling a simulated barracks environment through situated natural language instruction. In doing so, it builds a sizable task hierarchy composed of both innate and learned tasks, tasks formulated as achieving a goal or following a procedure, tasks with conditional branches and loops, and involving communicative and mental actions. Rosie is implemented in the Soar cognitive architecture, and represents tasks using a declarative task network which it compiles into procedural rules through chunking. This is key to allowing it to learn from a single training episode and generalize quickly.

**Abstract**:

As an independent social and economic entity, game servers plays a dominant role in building a stable, living, and attractive virtual world in massive multi-player online role-playing games (MMORPGs). We propose and implement a novel intelligent decision support system for server merge (SM) for maintaining the game ecology at the macro level. The services provided by this system include server health diagnosis, server merge assessment, and combination strategy recommendation. Specifically, we design an effective time series prediction algorithm to diagnose the health status of one server (e.g., user activity, online time, daily revenue) based on real game scenarios, and then select the servers with poor status from all servers. Moreover, to dig out the inherent development laws of servers from the historical merge records, we leverage a correlation measurement algorithm to find the historical merged servers that are similar to the servers to be merged and then evaluate the potential trend after merging, which can assist experts to make reasonable decisions. We deploy our system into practice for multiple MMORPGs and achieve sound online performance endorsed by the game operation team.

**Abstract**:

The conversational recommender systems (CRSs) have received extensive attention in recent years. However, most of the existing works focus on various deep learning models, which are largely limited by the requirement of large-scale human-annotated datasets. Such methods are not able to deal with the cold-start scenarios in industrial products. To alleviate the problem, we propose FORCE, a Framework Of Rule-based Conversational rEcommender system that helps developers to quickly build CRS bots by simple configuration. We conduct experiments on two datasets in different languages and domains to verify its effectiveness and usability.

In recent years, the automation of machine learning and data science (AutoML) has attracted significant attention. One under-explored dimension of AutoML is being able to automatically utilize domain knowledge (such as semantic concepts and relationships) located in historical code or literature from the problem's domain. In this paper, we demonstrate Semantic Feature Discovery, which enables users to interactively explore features semantically discovered from existing data science code and external knowledge. It does so by detecting semantic concepts for a given dataset, and then using these concepts to determine relevant feature engineering operations from historical code and knowledge.

**Abstract**:

Pre-trained multilingual language models are gaining popularity due to their cross-lingual zero-shot transfer ability, but these models do not perform equally well in all languages. Evaluating task-specific performance of a model in a large number of languages is often a challenge due to lack of labeled data, as is targeting improvements in low performing languages through few-shot learning. We present a tool - LITMUS
Predictor - that can make reliable performance projections for a fine-tuned task-specific model in a set of languages without test and training data, and help strategize data labeling efforts to optimize performance and fairness objectives.

**Abstract**:

Sound event detection aims to identify the sound events in the audio recordings, whose applications seem to be evident in our daily life, such as the surveillance and monitoring applications.
In this paper, we present a novel framework for the detection task, by combining using several improvements.
To compress the model efficiently while retaining the detection accuracy, the self-distillation paradigm is employed to improve offline training. To empower the machines with the ability of uncertainty estimation, the Monte Carlo dropout is used in our framework. Moreover, the inference data augmentation strategy is utilized to improve the robustness of the detection task.
Lastly, we present an interactive interface, which can be used to visualize the detection and the uncertainty for the prediction. We hope our tool can be helpful for practical machine listening.
