**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27070](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27070)

**Abstract**:

Human guides in museums and galleries are professionally trained to stimulate informal 
learning in visitors by asking low-risk, open-ended reflective questions
that enable them to
focus on specific features of artifacts, 
relate to prior experiences, and elicit  curiosity as well as further thought. We present ArtMuse, our AI-powered chatbot for asking reflective questions in context of paintings. Our reflective question generation model in ArtMuse
was trained by applying a
novel combination of existing models for
extractive question answering and open-domain chitchat. User evaluation studies indicate that we are able to generate fluent and specific reflective questions for paintings that are highly-engaging.

**Conference**: *aaai 2023*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27071](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27071)

**Abstract**:

We propose an AI-based pilot trainer to help students learn how to fly aircraft. First, an AI agent uses behavioral cloning to learn flying maneuvers from qualified flight instructors. Later, the system uses the agent's decisions to detect errors made by students and provide feedback to help students correct their errors. This paper presents an instantiation of the pilot trainer. We focus on teaching straight and level flying maneuvers by automatically providing formative feedback to the human student.

## [2003] DFEE: Interactive DataFlow Execution and Evaluation Kit

**Authors**: *Han He, Song Feng, Daniele Bonadiman, Yi Zhang, Saab Mansour*

**Conference**: *aaai 2023*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27073](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27073)

**Abstract**:

DataFlow has been emerging as a new paradigm for building task-oriented chatbots due to its expressive semantic representations of the dialogue tasks. Despite the availability of a large dataset SMCalFlow and a simplified syntax, the development and evaluation of DataFlow-based chatbots remain challenging due to the system complexity and the lack of downstream toolchains. In this demonstration, we present DFEE, an interactive DataFlow Execution and Evaluation toolkit that supports execution, visualization and benchmarking of semantic parsers given dialogue input and backend database. We demonstrate the system via a complex dialog task: event scheduling that involves temporal reasoning. It also supports diagnosing the parsing results via a friendly interface that allows developers to examine dynamic DataFlow and the corresponding execution results. To illustrate how to benchmark SoTA models, we propose a novel benchmark that covers more sophisticated event scheduling scenarios and a new metric on task success evaluation. The codes of DFEE have been released on https://github.com/amazonscience/dataflow-evaluation-toolkit.

## [2004] NCTV: Neural Clamping Toolkit and Visualization for Neural Network Calibration

**Authors**: *Lei Hsiung, Yung-Chen Tang, Pin-Yu Chen, Tsung-Yi Ho*

**Conference**: *aaai 2023*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27074](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27074)

**Abstract**:

With the advancement of deep learning technology, neural networks have demonstrated their excellent ability to provide accurate predictions in many tasks. However, a lack of consideration for neural network calibration will not gain trust from humans, even for high-accuracy models. In this regard, the gap between the confidence of the model's predictions and the actual correctness likelihood must be bridged to derive a well-calibrated model. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Clamping Toolkit, the first open-source framework designed to help developers employ state-of-the-art model-agnostic calibrated models. Furthermore, we provide animations and interactive sections in the demonstration to familiarize researchers with calibration in neural networks. A Colab tutorial on utilizing our toolkit is also introduced.

**Abstract**:

Couples often encounter the challenge of sharing house chores.  This raises the fundamental question of how to divide chores. In this paper, we present a new application for a fair division of household chores. Our platform, called Kajibuntan, allows couples to specify the set of chores to be shared, their preferences over them, and the current allocation. Our tool visualizes the current allocation and makes proposals according to their preferences based on the theory of fair division. The goal of our tool is to provide a systematic and transparent system to divide household chores and help creating harmony in the home.

## [2008] Robust-MSA: Understanding the Impact of Modality Noise on Multimodal Sentiment Analysis

**Authors**: *Huisheng Mao, Baozheng Zhang, Hua Xu, Ziqi Yuan, Yihe Liu*

**Conference**: *aaai 2023*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27078](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27078)

**Abstract**:

Improving model robustness against potential modality noise, as an essential step for adapting multimodal models to real-world applications, has received increasing attention among researchers. For Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), there is also a debate on whether multimodal models are more effective against noisy features than unimodal ones. Stressing on intuitive illustration and in-depth analysis of these concerns, we present Robust-MSA, an interactive platform that visualizes the impact of modality noise as well as simple defence methods to help researchers know better about how their models perform with imperfect real-world data.

## [2009] GAAMA 20: An Integrated System That Answers Boolean and Extractive Questions

**Authors**: *J. Scott McCarley, Mihaela Bornea, Sara Rosenthal, Anthony Ferritto, Md. Arafat Sultan, Avirup Sil, Radu Florian*

**Conference**: *aaai 2023*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27079](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27079)

**Abstract**:

Recent machine reading comprehension datasets include extractive and boolean questions but current approaches do not offer integrated support for answering both question types. We present a front-end demo to a multilingual machine reading comprehension system that handles boolean and extractive questions. It provides a yes/no answer and highlights the supporting evidence for boolean questions. It provides an answer for extractive questions and highlights the answer in the passage. Our system, GAAMA 2.0, achieved first place on the TyDi QA leaderboard at the time of submission. We contrast two different implementations of our approach: including multiple transformer models for easy deployment, and a shared transformer model utilizing adapters to reduce GPU memory footprint for a resource-constrained environment.

**Authors**: *Anaïs Ollagnier, Elena Cabrio, Serena Villata, Sara Tonelli*

**Conference**: *aaai 2023*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27080](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27080)

**Abstract**:

Recent studies have highlighted that private instant messaging platforms and channels are major media of cyber aggression, especially among teens. Due to the private nature of the verbal exchanges on these media, few studies have addressed the task of hate speech detection in this context. Moreover, the recent release of resources mimicking online aggression situations that may occur among teens on private instant messaging platforms is encouraging the development of solutions aiming at dealing with diversity in digital harassment. In this study, we present BiRDy: a fully Web-based platform performing participant role detection in multi-party chats. Leveraging the pre-trained language model mBERT (multilingual BERT), we release fine-tuned models relying on various contextual window strategies to classify exchanged messages according to the role of involvement in cyberbullying of the authors. Integrating a role scoring function, the proposed pipeline predicts a unique role for each chat participant. In addition, detailed confidence scoring are displayed. Currently, BiRDy publicly releases models for French and Italian.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27082](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27082)

**Abstract**:

We present nBIIG, a neural Business Intelligence (BI) Insights Generation system. Given a table, our system applies various analyses to create corresponding RDF representations, and then uses a neural model to generate fluent textual insights out of these representations. The generated insights can be used by an analyst, via a human-in-the-loop paradigm, to enhance the task of creating compelling table reports. The underlying generative neural model is trained over large and carefully distilled data, curated from multiple BI domains. Thus, the system can generate faithful and fluent insights over open-domain tables, making it practical and useful.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27083](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27083)

**Abstract**:

Currently, there is renewed interest in logic-related solutions for AI and Computer Science. The availability of software tools to support the realization of such studies (both as powerful and versatile prototyping tools and as teaching tools) has become a necessity. Intending to contribute to this field, we present a tool that allows the unification of different logic tasks, focused on Computer Logic but adaptable to the treatment in several subfields, contexts, and abstraction levels (LogicUS-LIB, LogicUS-NB, LogicUS-GUI).  

The tool provides a sound framework for two activity fields. On the one hand, in the topic of logic-based systems research, prototyping is facilitated in a relatively fast, simple, and highly adaptable way. On the other hand, in Education, by allowing the student to abstract from low-level execution of algorithms whilst preserving the conceptual structures and procedural methodologies underlying the logical foundations.

**Abstract**:

We propose KnowGL, a tool that allows converting text into structured relational data represented as a set of ABox assertions compliant with the TBox of a given Knowledge Graph (KG), such as Wikidata. 
We address this problem as a sequence generation task by leveraging pre-trained sequence-to-sequence language models, e.g. BART.
Given a sentence, we fine-tune such models to detect pairs of entity mentions and jointly generate a set of facts consisting of the full set of semantic annotations for a KG, such as entity labels, entity types, and their relationships.
To showcase the capabilities of our tool, we build a web application consisting of a set of UI widgets that help users to navigate through the semantic data extracted from a given input text. We make the KnowGL model available at https://huggingface.co/ibm/knowgl-large.

**Abstract**:

After the pandemic, artificial intelligence (AI) powered support for mental health care has become increasingly important. The breadth and complexity of significant challenges required to provide adequate care involve:
(a) Personalized patient understanding, (b) Safety-constrained and medically validated chatbot patient interactions, and (c) Support for continued feedback-based refinements in design using chatbot-patient interactions. 
We propose Alleviate, a chatbot designed to assist patients suffering from mental health challenges with personalized care and assist clinicians with understanding their patients better. Alleviate draws from an array of publicly available clinically valid mental-health texts and databases, allowing Alleviate to make medically sound and informed decisions. In addition, Alleviate's modular design and explainable decision-making lends itself to robust and continued feedback-based refinements to its design. In this paper, we explain the different modules of Alleviate and submit a short video demonstrating Alleviate's capabilities to help patients and clinicians understand each other better to facilitate optimal care strategies.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27086](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27086)

**Abstract**:

Search engines and conversational assistants are commonly used to help users complete their every day tasks such as booking travel, cooking, etc. While there are some existing datasets that can be used for this purpose, their coverage is limited to very few domains. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge base, ‘Task2KB’, which is constructed using data crawled from WikiHow, an online knowledge resource offering instructional articles on a wide range of tasks. Task2KB encapsulates various types of task-related information and attributes, such as requirements, detailed step description, and available methods to complete tasks. Due to its higher coverage compared to existing related knowledge graphs, Task2KB can be highly useful in the development of general purpose task completion assistants.

## [2017] CodeStylist: A System for Performing Code Style Transfer Using Neural Networks

**Authors**: *Chih-Kai Ting, Karl Munson, Serenity Wade, Anish Savla, Kiran Kate, Kavitha Srinivas*

**Conference**: *aaai 2023*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27087](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27087)

**Abstract**:

Code style refers to attributes of computer programs that affect their readability, maintainability, and performance. Enterprises consider code style as important and enforce style requirements during code commits. Tools that assist in coding style compliance and transformations are highly valuable. However, many key aspects of programming style transfer are difficult to automate, as it can be challenging to specify the patterns required to perform the transfer algorithmically.  In this paper, we describe a system called CodeStylist which uses neural methods to perform style transfer on code.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27088](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27088)

**Abstract**:

This paper presents AnoViz, a novel visualization tool of anomalies in multivariate time series, to support domain experts and data scientists in understanding anomalous instances in their systems. AnoViz provides an overall summary of time series as well as detailed visualizations of relevant detected anomalies in both query and stream modes, rendering near real-time visual analysis available. Here, we show that AnoViz streamlines the process of finding a potential cause of an anomaly with a deeper analysis of anomalous instances, giving explainability to any anomaly detector.

## [2019] CLUE-AD: A Context-Based Method for Labeling Unobserved Entities in Autonomous Driving Data

**Authors**: *Ruwan Wickramarachchi, Cory A. Henson, Amit P. Sheth*

**Conference**: *aaai 2023*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27089](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27089)

**Abstract**:

Generating high-quality annotations for object detection and recognition is a challenging and important task, especially in relation to safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving (AD). Due to the difficulty of perception in challenging situations such as occlusion, degraded weather, and sensor failure, objects can go unobserved and unlabeled. In this paper, we present CLUE-AD, a general-purpose method for detecting and labeling unobserved entities by leveraging the object continuity assumption within the context of a scene. This method is dataset-agnostic, supporting any existing and future AD datasets. Using a real-world dataset representing complex urban driving scenes, we demonstrate the applicability of CLUE-AD for detecting unobserved entities and augmenting the scene data with new labels.

## [2020] An Online Presentation Slide Assessment System Using Visual and Semantic Segmentation Features

**Authors**: *Shengzhou Yi, Junichiro Matsugami, Hiroshi Yumoto, Toshihiko Yamasaki*

**Conference**: *aaai 2023*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27090](https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i13.27090)

**Abstract**:

In this study, we present a new presentation slide assessment system that can extract the structural features from any slide file formats. Our previous work used a neural network to identify novice vs. well-designed presentation slides based on visual and structural features. However, the structural feature extraction was only applicable to PowerPoint files. To solve this problem, we extract the semantic segmentation from the slide images as a new format of structural features. The proposed multi-modal Transformer extracts the features from the original images and semantic segmentation results to assess the slide design. The prediction targets are the top-10 checkpoints pointed out by the professional consultants. Class-imbalanced learning and multi-task learning methods are also applied to improve the accuracy. The proposed model only requiring the slide images achieved an average accuracy of 81.67% that is comparative to the performance of the previous work requiring the PowerPoint files.
