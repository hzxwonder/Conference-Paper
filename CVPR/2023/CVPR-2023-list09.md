        **Abstract**:

        Reverse engineering CAD models from raw geometry is a classic but strenuous research problem. Previous learning-based methods rely heavily on labels due to the supervised design patterns or reconstruct CAD shapes that are not easily editable. In this work, we introduce SECADNet, an end-to-end neural network aimed at reconstructing compact and easy-to-edit CAD models in a self-supervised manner. Drawing inspiration from the modeling language that is most commonly used in modern CAD software, we propose to learn 2D sketches and 3D extrusion parameters from raw shapes, from which a set of extrusion cylinders can be generated by extruding each sketch from a 2D plane into a 3D body. By incorporating the Boolean operation (i.e., union), these cylinders can be combined to closely approximate the target geometry. We advocate the use of implicit fields for sketch representation, which allows for creating CAD variations by interpolating latent codes in the sketch latent space. Extensive experiments on both ABC and Fusion 360 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and show superiority over state-of-the-art alternatives including the closely related method for supervised CAD reconstruction. We further apply our approach to CAD editing and single-view CAD reconstruction. Code will be released at https://github.com/BunnySoCrazy/SECAD-Net.

        **Abstract**:

        Cartoonization is a task that renders natural photos into cartoon styles. Previous deep cartoonization methods only have focused on end-to-end translation, which may hinder editability. Instead, we propose a novel solution with editing features of texture and color based on the cartoon creation process. To do that, we design a model architecture to have separate decoders, texture and color, to decouple these attributes. In the texture decoder, we propose a texture controller, which enables a user to control stroke style and abstraction to generate diverse cartoon textures. We also introduce an HSV color augmentation to induce the networks to generate diverse and controllable color translation. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first deep approach to control the cartoonization at inference while showing profound quality improvement over to baselines.

        **Abstract**:

        We propose a novel method for high-quality facial texture reconstruction from RGB images using a novel capturing routine based on a single smartphone which we equip with an inexpensive polarization foil. Specifically, we turn the flashlight into a polarized light source and add a polarization filter on top of the camera. Leveraging this setup, we capture the face of a subject with cross-polarized and parallel-polarized light. For each subject, we record two short sequences in a dark environment under flash illumination with different light polarization using the modified smartphone. Based on these observations, we reconstruct an explicit surface mesh of the face using structure from motion. We then exploit the camera and light colocation within a differentiable renderer to optimize the facial textures using an analysis-by-synthesis approach. Our method optimizes for high-resolution normal textures, diffuse albedo, and specular albedo using a coarse-to-fine optimization scheme. We show that the optimized textures can be used in a standard rendering pipeline to synthesize high-quality photo-realistic 3D digital humans in novel environments.

        **Abstract**:

        We present GlassesGAN, a novel image editing frame-work for custom design of glasses, that sets a new standard in terms of output-image quality, edit realism, and continuous multi-style edit capability. To facilitate the editing process with GlassesGAN, we propose a Targeted Subspace Modelling (TSM) procedure that, based on a novel mechanism for (synthetic) appearance discovery in the latent space of a pre-trained GAN generator, constructs an eyeglasses-specific (latent) subspace that the editing framework can utilize. Additionally, we also introduce an appearance-constrained subspace initialization (SI) technique that centers the latent representation of the given input image in the well-defined part of the constructed sub-space to improve the reliability of the learned edits. We test GlassesGAN on two (diverse) high-resolution datasets (CelebA-HQ and SiblingsDB-HQf) and compare it to three state-of-the-art baselines, i.e., InterfaceGAN, GANSpace, and MaskGAN. The reported results show that GlassesGAN convincingly outperforms all competing techniques, while offering functionality (e.g., fine-grained multi-style editing) not available with any of the competitors. The source code for GlassesGAN is made publicly available.

        **Abstract**:

        Neural networks for facial landmark detection are notoriously limited to a fixed set of landmarks in a dedicated layout, which must be specified at training time. Dedicated datasets must also be hand-annotated with the corresponding landmark configuration for training. We propose the first facial landmark detection network that can predict continuous, unlimited landmarks, allowing to specify the number and location of the desired landmarks at inference time. Our method combines a simple image feature extractor with a queried landmark predictor, and the user can specify any continuous query points relative to a 3D template face mesh as input. As it is not tied to a fixed set of landmarks, our method is able to leverage all pre-existing 2D landmark datasets for training, even if they have inconsistent landmark configurations. As a result, we present a very powerful facial landmark detector that can be trained once, and can be used readily for numerous applications like 3D face reconstruction, arbitrary face segmentation, and is even compatible with helmeted mounted cameras, and therefore could vastly simplify face tracking workflows for media and entertainment applications.

        **Abstract**:

        Realistic face rendering from multi-view images is beneficial to various computer vision and graphics applications. Due to complex spatially-varying reflectance properties and geometry characteristics of faces, however, it remains challenging to recover 3D facial representations both faithfully and efficiently in the current studies. This paper presents a novel 3D face rendering model, namely NeuFace, to learn accurate and physically-meaningful underlying 3D representations by neural rendering techniques. It naturally in-corporates the neural BRDFs into physically based rendering, capturing sophisticated facial geometry and appearance clues in a collaborative manner. Specifically, we introduce an approximated BRDF integration and a simple yet new low-rank prior, which effectively lower the ambiguities and boost the performance of the facial BRDFs. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the superiority of NeuFace in human face rendering, along with a decent generalization ability to common objects. Code is released at NeuFace.

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01619](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01619)

        **Abstract**:

        In this work, we present a multimodal solution to the problem of 4D face reconstruction from monocular videos. 3D face reconstruction from 2D images is an under-constrained problem due to the ambiguity of depth. State-of-the-art methods try to solve this problem by leveraging visual information from a single image or video, whereas 3D mesh animation approaches rely more on audio. However, in most cases (e.g. AR/VR applications), videos include both visual and speech information. We propose AV-Face that incorporates both modalities and accurately re-constructs the 4D facial and lip motion of any speaker, without requiring any 3D ground truth for training. A coarse stage estimates the per-frame parameters of a 3D mor-phable model, followed by a lip refinement, and then a fine stage recovers facial geometric details. Due to the temporal audio and video information captured by transformer-based modules, our method is robust in cases when either modality is insufficient (e.g. face occlusions). Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates the superiority of our method over the current state-of-the-art.

        **Abstract**:

        We propose a method to learn a high-quality implicit 3D head avatar from a monocular RGB video captured in the wild. The learnt avatar is driven by a parametric face model to achieve user-controlled facial expressions and head poses. Our hybrid pipeline combines the geometry prior and dynamic tracking of a 3DMM with a neural radiance field to achieve fine-grained control and photorealism. To reduce over-smoothing and improve out-of-model expressions synthesis, we propose to predict local features anchored on the 3DMM geometry. These learnt features are driven by 3DMM deformation and interpolated in 3D space to yield the volumetric radiance at a designated query point. We further show that using a Convolutional Neural Network in the UV space is critical in incorporating spatial context and producing representative local features. Extensive experiments show that we are able to reconstruct high-quality avatars, with more accurate expression-dependent details, good generalization to out-of-training expressions, and quantitatively superior renderings compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

        **Abstract**:

        Controllability, generalizability and efficiency are the major objectives of constructing face avatars represented by neural implicit field. However, existing methods have not managed to accommodate the three requirements simultaneously. They either focus on static portraits, restricting the representation ability to a specific subject, or suffer from substantial computational cost, limiting their flexibility. In this paper, we propose One-shot Talking face Avatar (OTAvatar), which constructs face avatars by a generalized controllable tri-plane rendering solution so that each personalized avatar can be constructed from only one portrait as the reference. Specifically, OTAvatar first inverts a portrait image to a motion-free identity code. Second, the identity code and a motion code are utilized to modulate an efficient CNN to generate a tri-plane formulated volume, which encodes the subject in the desired motion. Finally, volume rendering is employed to generate an image in any view. The core of our solution is a novel decoupling-by-inverting strategy that disentangles identity and motion in the latent code via optimization-based inversion. Benefiting from the efficient tri-plane representation, we achieve controllable rendering of generalized face avatar at 35 FPS on AIOO. Experiments show promising performance of crossidentity reenactment on subjects out of the training set and better 3D consistency. The code is available at https://github.com/theEricMaIOTAvatar.

        **Abstract**:

        We present X-Avatar, a novel avatar model that captures the full expressiveness of digital humans to bring about life-like experiences in telepresence, AR/VR and beyond. Our method models bodies, hands, facial expressions and appearance in a holistic fashion and can be learned from either full 3D scans or RGB-D data. To achieve this, we propose a part-aware learned forward skinning module that can be driven by the parameter space of SMPL-X, allowing for expressive animation of X-Avatars. To efficiently learn the neural shape and deformation fields, we propose novel part-aware sampling and initialization strategies. This leads to higher fidelity results, especially for smaller body parts while maintaining efficient training despite increased number of articulated bones. To capture the appearance of the avatar with high-frequency details, we extend the geometry and deformation fields with a texture network that is conditioned on pose, facial expression, geometry and the normals of the deformed surface. We show experimentally that our method outperforms strong baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively on the animation task. To facilitate future research on expressive avatars we contribute a new dataset, called X-Humans, containing 233 sequences of high-quality textured scans from 20 participants, totalling 35,500 data frames.

        In this paper, we take one step further towards real-world applicability of monocular neural avatar reconstruction by contributing InstantAvatar, a system that can reconstruct human avatars from a monocular video within seconds, and these avatars can be animated and rendered at an inter-active rate. To achieve this efficiency we propose a carefully designed and engineered system, that leverages emerging acceleration structures for neural fields, in combination with an efficient empty-space skipping strategy for dynamic scenes. We also contribute an efficient implementation that we will make available for research purposes. Compared to existing methods, InstantAvatar converges 130x faster and can be trained in minutes instead of hours. It achieves comparable or even better reconstruction quality and novel pose synthesis results. When given the same time budget, our method significantly outperforms SoTA methods. In-stantAvatar can yield acceptable visual quality in as little as 10 seconds training time. For code and more demo results, please refer to https://ait.ethz.ch/InstantAvatar.

        **Abstract**:

        This paper presents JAWS, an optimization-driven approach that achieves the robust transfer of visual cinematic features from a reference in-the-wild video clip to a newly generated clip. To this end, we rely on an implicit-neural-representation (INR) in a way to compute a clip that shares the same cinematic features as the reference clip. We propose a general formulation of a camera optimization problem in an INR that computes extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameters as well as timing. By leveraging the differentiability of neural representations, we can back-propagate our designed cinematic losses measured on proxy estimators through a NeRF network to the proposed cinematic parameters directly. We also introduce specific enhancements such as guidance maps to improve the overall quality and efficiency. Results display the capacity of our system to replicate well known camera sequences from movies, adapting the framing, camera parameters and timing of the generated video clip to maximize the similarity with the reference clip.

        **Abstract**:

        Animating virtual avatars with free-view control is crucial for various applications like virtual reality and digital entertainment. Previous studies have attempted to utilize the representation power of the neural radiance field (NeRF) to reconstruct the human body from monocular videos. Recent works propose to graft a deformation network into the NeRF to further model the dynamics of the human neural field for animating vivid human motions. However, such pipelines either rely on pose-dependent representations or fall short of motion coherency due to frameindependent optimization, making it difficult to generalize to unseen pose sequences realistically. In this paper, we propose a novel framework MonoHuman, which robustly renders view-consistent and high-fidelity avatars under arbitrary novel poses. Our key insight is to model the deformation field with bi-directional constraints and explicitly leverage the off-the-peg keyframe information to reason the feature correlations for coherent results. Specifically, we first propose a Shared Bidirectional Deformation module, which creates a pose-independent generalizable deformation field by disentangling backward and forward deformation correspondences into shared skeletal motion weight and separate non-rigid motions. Then, we devise a Forward Correspondence Search module, which queries the correspondence feature of keyframes to guide the rendering network. The rendered results are thus multi-view consistent with high fidelity, even under challenging novel pose settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MonoHuman over state-of-the-art methods.

        **Abstract**:

        We introduce Structured 3D Features, a model based on a novel implicit 3D representation that pools pixel-aligned image features onto dense 3D points sampled from a parametric, statistical human mesh surface. The 3D points have associated semantics and can move freely in 3D space. This allows for optimal coverage of the person of interest, beyond just the body shape, which in turn, additionally helps modeling accessories, hair, and loose clothing. Owing to this, we present a complete 3D transformer-based attention framework which, given a single image of a person in an unconstrained pose, generates an animatable 3D reconstruction with albedo and illumination decomposition, as a result of a single end-to-end model, trained semi-supervised, and with no additional postprocessing. We show that our S3F model surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on various tasks, including monocular 3D reconstruction, as well as albedo & shading estimation. Moreover, we show that the proposed methodology allows novel view synthesis, relighting, and re-posing the reconstruction, and can naturally be extended to handle multiple input images (e.g. different views of a person, or the same view, in different poses, in video). Finally, we demonstrate the editing capabilities of our model for 3D virtual try-on applications.

        **Abstract**:

        We propose a method that leverages graph neural networks, multi-level message passing, and unsupervised training to enable efficient prediction of realistic clothing dynamics. Whereas existing methods based on linear blend skinning must be trained for specific garments, our method, called HOOD, is agnostic to body shape and applies to tight-fitting garments as well as loose, free-flowing clothing. Furthermore, HOOD handles changes in topology (e.g., garments with buttons or zippers) and material properties at inference time. As one key contribution, we propose a hierarchical message-passing scheme that efficiently propagates stiff stretching modes while preserving local detail. We empirically show that HOOD outperforms strong baselines quantitatively and that its results are perceived as more realistic than state-of-the-art methods.

        **Abstract**:

        Recent works have proposed to craft adversarial clothes for evading person detectors, while they are either only effective at limited viewing angles or very conspicuous to humans. We aim to craft adversarial texture for clothes based on 3D modeling, an idea that has been used to craft rigid adversarial objects such as a 3D-printed turtle. Unlike rigid objects, humans and clothes are non-rigid, leading to difficulties in physical realization. In order to craft natural-looking adversarial clothes that can evade person detectors at multiple viewing angles, we propose adversarial camou-flage textures (AdvCaT) that resemble one kind of the typical textures of daily clothes, camouflage textures. We leverage the Voronoi diagram and Gumbel-softmax trick to parameterize the camouflage textures and optimize the parameters via 3D modeling. Moreover, we propose an efficient augmentation pipeline on 3D meshes combining topologically plausible projection (TopoProj) and Thin Plate Spline (TPS) to narrow the gap between digital and real-world objects. We printed the developed 3D texture pieces on fabric materials and tailored them into T-shirts and trousers. Experiments show high attack success rates of these clothes against multiple detectors.

        **Abstract**:

        3D human body representation learning has received increasing attention in recent years. However, existing works cannot flexibly, controllably and accurately represent human bodies, limited by coarse semantics and unsatisfactory representation capability, particularly in the absence of supervised data. In this paper, we propose a human body representation with fine-grained semantics and high reconstruction-accuracy in an unsupervised setting. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between latent vectors and geometric measures of body parts by designing a part-aware skeleton-separated decoupling strategy, which facilitates controllable editing of human bodies by modifying the corresponding latent codes. With the help of a bone-guided auto-encoder and an orientation-adaptive weighting strategy, our representation can be trained in an unsupervised manner. With the geometrically meaningful latent space, it can be applied to a wide range of applications, from human body editing to latent code interpolation and shape style transfer. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the accurate reconstruction and flexible editing abilities of the proposed method. The code will be available at http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/SemanticHuman.

        **Abstract**:

        Building animatable 3D models is challenging due to the need for 3D scans, laborious registration, and rigging. Recently, differentiable rendering provides a pathway to obtain high-quality 3D models from monocular videos, but these are limited to rigid categories or single instances. We present RAC, a method to build category-level 3D models from monocular videos, disentangling variations over instances and motion over time. Three key ideas are introduced to solve this problem: (1) specializing a category-level skeleton to instances, (2) a method for latent space regularization that encourages shared structure across a category while maintaining instance details, and (3) using 3D background models to disentangle objects from the background. We build 3D models for humans, cats and dogs given monocular videos. Project page: https://gengshan-y.github.io/rac-www/.

        **Abstract**:

        We present Deformable mesh transFormer (DeFormer), a novel vertex-based approach to monocular 3D human mesh recovery. DeFormer iteratively fits a body mesh model to an input image via a mesh alignment feedback loop formed within a transformer decoder that is equipped with efficient body mesh driven attention modules: 1) body sparse self-attention and 2) deformable mesh cross attention. As a result, DeFormer can effectively exploit high-resolution image feature maps and a dense mesh model which were computationally expensive to deal with in previous approaches using the standard transformer attention. Experimental results show that DeFormer achieves state-of-the-art performances on the Human3.6M and 3DPW benchmarks. Ablation study is also conducted to show the effectiveness of the DeFormer model designs for leveraging multi-scale feature maps. Code is available at https://github.com/yusukey03012/DeFormer.

        **Abstract**:

        We propose Hi4D, a method and dataset for the automatic analysis of physically close human-human interaction under prolonged contact. Robustly disentangling several in-contact subjects is a challenging task due to occlusions and complex shapes. Hence, existing multi-view systems typically fuse 3D surfaces of close subjects into a single, connected mesh. To address this issue we leverage i) individually fitted neural implicit avatars; ii) an alternating optimization scheme that refines pose and surface through periods of close proximity; and iii) thus segment the fused raw scans into individual instances. From these instances we compile Hi4D dataset of 4D textured scans of 20 subject pairs, 100 sequences, and a total of more than 11 K frames. Hi4D contains rich interaction-centric annotations in 2D and 3D alongside accurately registered parametric body models. We define varied human pose and shape estimation tasks on this dataset and provide results from state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks. Hi4D dataset can be found at https://ait.ethz.ch/Hi4D.

        ## [1620] Bringing Inputs to Shared Domains for 3D Interacting Hands Recovery in the Wild

        **Authors**: *Gyeongsik Moon*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01633](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01633)

        **Abstract**:

        Despite recent achievements, existing 3D interacting hands recovery methods have shown results mainly on motion capture (MoCap) environments, not on in-the-wild (ITW) ones. This is because collecting 3D interacting hands data in the wild is extremely challenging, even for the 2D data. We present InterWild, which brings MoCap and ITW samples to shared domains for robust 3D interacting hands recovery in the wild with a limited amount of ITW 2D/3D interacting hands data. 3D interacting hands recovery consists of two sub-problems: 1) 3D recovery of each hand and 2) 3D relative translation recovery between two hands. For the first sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a shared 2D scale space. Although ITW datasets provide a limited amount of 2D/3D interacting hands, they contain large-scale 2D single hand data. Motivated by this, we use a single hand image as an input for the first sub-problem regardless of whether two hands are interacting. Hence, interacting hands of MoCap datasets are brought to the 2D scale space of single hands of ITW datasets. For the second sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a shared appearance-invariant space. Unlike the first sub-problem, 2D labels of ITW datasets are not helpful for the second sub-problem due to the 3D translation's ambiguity. Hence, instead of relying on ITW samples, we amplify the generalizability of MoCap samples by taking only a geometric feature without an image as an input for the second sub-problem. As the geometric feature is invariant to appearances, MoCap and ITW samples do not suffer from a huge appearance gap between the two datasets. The code is publicly available

        ## [1621] Learning Human Mesh Recovery in 3D Scenes

        **Abstract**:

        We present a novel method for recovering the absolute pose and shape of a human in a pre-scanned scene given a single image. Unlike previous methods that perform scene-aware mesh optimization, we propose to first estimate absolute position and dense scene contacts with a sparse 3D CNN, and later enhance a pretrained human mesh recovery network by cross-attention with the derived 3D scene cues. Joint learning on images and scene geometry enables our method to reduce the ambiguity caused by depth and occlusion, resulting in more reasonable global postures and contacts. Encoding scene-aware cues in the network also allows the proposed method to be optimization-free, and opens up the opportunity for real-time applications. The experiments show that the proposed network is capable of recovering accurate and physically-plausible meshes by a single forward pass and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and speed.

        **Abstract**:

        Real-time 3D hand mesh reconstruction is challenging, especially when the hand is holding some object. Beyond the previous methods, we design H2ONet to fully exploit non-occluded information from multiple frames to boost the reconstruction quality. First, we decouple hand mesh reconstruction into two branches, one to exploit finger-level nonoccluded information and the other to exploit global hand orientation, with lightweight structures to promote real-time inference. Second, we propose finger-level occlusionaware feature fusion, leveraging predicted finger-level occlusion information as guidance to fuse finger-level information across time frames. Further, we design hand-level occlusion-aware feature fusion to fetch non-occluded information from nearby time frames. We conduct experiments on the Dex-YCB and HO3D-v2 datasets with challenging hand-object occlusion cases, manifesting that H2ONet is able to run in real-time and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the hand mesh and pose precision. The code will be released on GitHub.

        **Abstract**:

        3D reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and the task is especially challenging when the object to reconstruct is partially or fully occluded. We introduce a method that uses the shadows cast by an unobserved object in order to infer the possible 3D volumes under occlusion. We create a differentiable image formation model that allows us to jointly infer the 3D shape of an object, its pose, and the position of a light source. Since the approach is end-to-end differentiable, we are able to integrate learned priors of object geometry in order to generate realistic 3D shapes of different object categories. Experiments and visualizations show that the method is able to generate multiple possible solutions that are consistent with the observation of the shadow. Our approach works even when the position of the light source and object pose are both unknown. Our approach is also robust to real-world images where ground-truth shadow mask is unknown.

        **Abstract**:

        In comparison with most methods focusing on 
<tex xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">$3D$</tex>
 rigid object recognition and manipulation, deformable objects are more common in our real life but attract less attention. Generally, most existing methods for deformable object manipulation suffer two issues, 1) Massive demonstration: repeating thousands of robot-object demonstrations for model training of one specific instance; 2) Poor generalization: inevitably re-training for transferring the learned skill to a similar/new instance from the same category. Therefore, we propose a category-level deformable 
<tex xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">$3D$</tex>
 object manipulation framework, which could manipulate deformable 
<tex xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">$3D$</tex>
 objects with only one demonstration and generalize the learned skills to new similar instances without re-training. Specifically, our proposed framework consists of two modules. The Nocs State Transform 
<tex xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">$(NST)$</tex>
 module transfers the observed point clouds of the target to a pre-defined unified pose state (i.e.,Nocs state), which is the foundation for the category-level manipulation learning; the Neural Spatial Encoding 
<tex xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">$(NSE)$</tex>
 module generalizes the learned skill to novel instances by encoding the category-level spatial information to pursue the expected grasping point without re-training. The relative motion path is then planned to achieve autonomous manipulation. Both the simulated results via our 
<tex xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">$\text{Cap}_{40}$</tex>

        ## [1625] In-Hand 3D Object Scanning from an RGB Sequence

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01638](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01638)

        **Abstract**:

        We propose a method for in-hand 3D scanning of an unknown object with a monocular camera. Our method relies on a neural implicit surface representation that captures both the geometry and the appearance of the object, however, by contrast with most NeRF-based methods, we do not assume that the camera-object relative poses are known. Instead, we simultaneously optimize both the object shape and the pose trajectory. As direct optimization over all shape and pose parameters is prone to fail without coarse-level initialization, we propose an incremental approach that starts by splitting the sequence into carefully selected overlapping segments within which the optimization is likely to succeed. We reconstruct the object shape and track its poses independently within each segment, then merge all the segments before performing a global optimization. We show that our method is able to reconstruct the shape and color of both textured and challenging texture-less objects, outperforms classical methods that rely only on appearance features, and that its performance is close to recent methods that assume known camera poses.

        **Abstract**:

        We study the problem of inferring scene affordances by presenting a method for realistically inserting people into scenes. Given a scene image with a marked region and an image of a person, we insert the person into the scene while respecting the scene affordances. Our model can infer the set of realistic poses given the scene context, re-pose the reference person, and harmonize the composition. We set up the task in a self-supervised fashion by learning to repose humans in video clips. We train a large-scale diffusion model on a dataset of 2.4M video clips that produces diverse plausible poses while respecting the scene context. Given the learned human-scene composition, our model can also hallucinate realistic people and scenes when prompted without conditioning and also enables interactive editing. A quantitative evaluation shows that our method synthesizes more realistic human appearance and more natural human-scene interactions than prior work.

        ## [1627] Detecting Human-Object Contact in Images

        **Abstract**:

        Humans constantly contact objects to move and perform tasks. Thus, detecting human-object contact is important for building human-centered artificial intelligence. However, there exists no robust method to detect contact between the body and the scene from an image, and there exists no dataset to learn such a detector. We fill this gap with HOT (‚ÄúHuman-Object conTact‚Äù), a new dataset of human-object contacts in images. To build HOT, we use two data sources: (1) We use the PROX dataset of 3D human meshes moving in 3D scenes, and automatically annotate 2D image areas for contact via 3D mesh proximity and projection. (2) We use the V-COCO, HAKE and Watch-n-Patch datasets, and ask trained annotators to draw polygons around the 2D image areas where contact takes place. We also annotate the involved body part of the human body. We use our HOT dataset to train a new contact detector, which takes a single color image as input, and outputs 2D contact heatmaps as well as the body-part labels that are in contact. This is a new and challenging task, that extends current foot-ground or hand-object contact detectors to the full generality of the whole body. The detector uses a part-attention branch to guide contact estimation through the context of the surrounding body parts and scene. We evaluate our detector extensively, and quantitative results show that our model outperforms baselines, and that all components contribute to better performance. Results on images from an online repository show reasonable detections and generalizability. Our HOT data and model are available for research at https://hot.is.tue.mpg.de.

        **Abstract**:

        Inferring past human motion from RGB images is challenging due to the inherent uncertainty of the prediction problem. Thermal images, on the other hand, encode traces of past human-object interactions left in the environment via thermal radiation measurement. Based on this observation, we collect the first RGB-Thermal dataset for human motion analysis, dubbed Thermal-1M. Then we develop a three-stage neural network model for accurate past human pose estimation. Comprehensive experiments show that thermal cues significantly reduce the ambiguities of this task, and the proposed model achieves remarkable performance. The dataset is available at https://github.com/ZitianTang/Thermal-IM.

        ## [1629] Trajectory-Aware Body Interaction Transformer for Multi-Person Pose Forecasting

        **Authors**: *Xiaogang Peng, Siyuan Mao, Zizhao Wu*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01642](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01642)

        **Abstract**:

        Multi-person pose forecasting remains a challenging problem, especially in modeling fine-grained human body interaction in complex crowd scenarios. Existing methods typically represent the whole pose sequence as a temporal series, yet overlook interactive influences among people based on skeletal body parts. In this paper, we propose a novel Trajectory-Aware Body Interaction Transformer (TBIFormer) for multi-person pose forecasting via effectively modeling body part interactions. Specifically, we construct a Temporal Body Partition Module that transforms all the pose sequences into a Multi-Person Body-Part sequence to retain spatial and temporal information based on body semantics. Then, we devise a Social Body Interaction Self-Attention (SBI-MSA) module, utilizing the transformed sequence to learn body part dynamics for inter- and intra-individual interactions. Furthermore, different from prior Euclidean distance-based spatial encodings, we present a novel and efficient Trajectory-Aware Relative Position Encoding for SBI-MSA to offer discriminative spatial information and additional interactive clues. On both short-and long-term horizons, we empirically evaluate our frame-work on CMU-Mocap, MuPoTS-3D as well as synthesized datasets (6 ~ 10 persons), and demonstrate that our method greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

        ## [1630] Mutual Information-Based Temporal Difference Learning for Human Pose Estimation in Video

        **Authors**: *Runyang Feng, Yixing Gao, Xueqing Ma, Tze Ho Elden Tse, Hyung Jin Chang*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **Abstract**:

        Temporal modeling is crucial for multi-frame human pose estimation. Most existing methods directly employ optical flow or deformable convolution to predict full-spectrum motion fields, which might incur numerous irrelevant cues, such as a nearby person or background. Without further efforts to excavate meaningful motion priors, their results are suboptimal, especially in complicated spatio-temporal interactions. On the other hand, the temporal difference has the ability to encode representative motion information which can potentially be valuable for pose estimation but has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we present a novel multi-frame human pose estimation framework, which employs temporal differences across frames to model dynamic contexts and engages mutual information objectively to facilitate useful motion information disentanglement. To be specific, we design a multi-stage Temporal Difference Encoder that performs incremental cascaded learning conditioned on multi-stage feature difference sequences to derive informative motion representation. We further propose a Representation Disentanglement module from the mutual information perspective, which can grasp discriminative task-relevant motion signals by explicitly defining useful and noisy constituents of the raw motion features and minimizing their mutual information. These place us to rank No.1 in the Crowd Pose Estimation in Complex Events Challenge on benchmark dataset HiEve, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks PoseTrack2017, PoseTrack2018, and PoseTrack21.

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01644](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01644)

        **Abstract**:

        Estimating 3D human motion from an egocentric video sequence plays a critical role in human behavior understanding and has various applications in VR/AR. However, naively learning a mapping between egocentric videos and human motions is challenging, because the user's body is often unobserved by the front-facing camera placed on the head of the user. In addition, collecting large-scale, high-quality datasets with paired egocentric videos and 3D human motions requires accurate motion capture devices, which often limit the variety of scenes in the videos to lab-like environments. To eliminate the need for paired egocentric video and human motions, we propose a new method, Ego-Body Pose Estimation via Ego-Head Pose Estimation (EgoEgo), which decomposes the problem into two stages, connected by the head motion as an intermediate representation. EgoEgo first integrates SLAM and a learning approach to estimate accurate head motion. Subsequently, leveraging the estimated head pose as input, EgoEgo utilizes conditional diffusion to generate multiple plausible full-body motions. This disentanglement of head and body pose eliminates the need for training datasets with paired egocentric videos and 3D human motion, enabling us to leverage large-scale egocentric video datasets and motion capture datasets separately. Moreover, for systematic benchmarking, we develop a synthetic dataset, AMASS-Replica-Ego-Syn (ARES), with paired egocentric videos and human motion. On both ARES and real data, our EgoEgo model performs significantly better than the current state-of-the-art methods.

        **Abstract**:

        Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, which localizes and infers relationships between human and objects, plays an important role in scene understanding. Although two-stage HOI detectors have advantages of high efficiency in training and inference, they suffer from lower performance than one-stage methods due to the old back-bone networks and the lack of considerations for the HOI perception process of humans in the interaction classifiers. In this paper, we propose Vision Transformer based Pose-Conditioned Self-Loop Graph (ViPLO) to resolve these problems. First, we propose a novel feature extraction method suitable for the Vision Transformer backbone, called masking with overlapped area (MOA) module. The MOA module utilizes the overlapped area between each patch and the given region in the attention function, which addresses the quantization problem when using the Vision Transformer backbone. In addition, we design a graph with a pose-conditioned self-loop structure, which updates the human node encoding with local features of human joints. This allows the classifier to focus on specific human joints to effectively identify the type of interaction, which is motivated by the human perception process for HOI. As a result, ViPLO achieves the state-of-the-art results on two public benchmarks, especially obtaining a +2.07 mAP performance gain on the HICO-DET dataset.

        **Abstract**:

        In this paper, we focus on the problem of category-level object pose estimation, which is challenging due to the large intra-category shape variation. 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) based methods have been widely used to extract local geometric features, but they have limitations for complex shaped objects and are sensitive to noise. Moreover, the scale and translation invariant properties of 3D-GC restrict the perception of an object's size and translation information. In this paper, we propose a simple network structure, the HS-layer, which extends 3D-GC to extract hybrid scope latent features from point cloud data for category-level object pose estimation tasks. The proposed HS-layer: 1) is able to perceive local-global geometric structure and global information, 2) is robust to noise, and 3) can encode size and translation information. Our experiments show that the simple replacement of the 3D-GC layer with the proposed HS-layer on the baseline method (GPV-Pose) achieves a significant improvement, with the performance increased by 14.5% on 5¬∞2cm metric and 10.3% on IoU

        **Abstract**:

        Animal pose estimation is an important but underexplored task due to the lack of labeled data. In this paper, we tackle the task of animal pose estimation with scarce annotations, where only a small set of labeled data and unlabeled images are available. At the core of the solution to this problem setting is the use of the unlabeled data to compensate for the lack of well-labeled animal pose data. To this end, we propose the ScarceNet, a pseudo label-based approach to generate artificial labels for the unlabeled images. The pseudo labels, which are generated with a model trained with the small set of labeled images, are generally noisy and can hurt the performance when directly used for training. To solve this problem, we first use a small-loss trick to select reliable pseudo labels. Although effective, the selection process is improvident since numerous high-loss samples are left unused. We further propose to identify reusable samples from the high-loss samples based on an agreement check. Pseudo labels are re-generated to provide supervision for those reusable samples. Lastly, we introduce a student-teacher framework to enforce a consistency constraint since there are still samples that are neither reliable nor reusable. By combining the reliable pseudo label selection with the reusable sample re-labeling and the consistency constraint, we can make full use of the unlabeled data. We evaluate our approach on the challenging AP-10K dataset, where our approach outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches by a large margin. We also test on the TigDog dataset, where our approach can achieve better performance than domain adaptation based approaches when only very few annotations are available.

        **Authors**: *Qiuxia Lin, Linlin Yang, Angela Yao*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01648](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01648)

        **Abstract**:

        Recent advances in hand pose estimation have shed light on utilizing synthetic data to train neural networks, which however inevitably hinders generalization to real-world data due to domain gaps. To solve this problem, we present a framework for cross-domain semi-supervised hand pose estimation and target the challenging scenario of learning models from labelled multimodal synthetic data and unlabelled real-world data. To that end, we propose a dual-modality network that exploits synthetic RGB and synthetic depth images. For pre-training, our network uses multi-modal contrastive learning and attention-fused supervision to learn effective representations of the RGB images. We then integrate a novel self-distillation technique during fine-tuning to reduce pseudo-label noise. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly improves 3D hand pose estimation and 2D keypoint detection on benchmarks.

        ## [1636] Linking Garment with Person via Semantically Associated Landmarks for Virtual Try-On

        **Authors**: *Keyu Yan, Tingwei Gao, Hui Zhang, Chengjun Xie*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01649](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01649)

        **Abstract**:

        In this paper, a novel virtual try-on algorithm, dubbed SAL-VTON, is proposed, which links the garment with the person via semantically associated landmarks to alleviate misalignment. The semantically associated landmarks are a series of landmark pairs with the same local semantics on the in-shop garment image and the try-on image. Based on the semantically associated landmarks, SAL-VTON effectively models the local semantic association between garment and person, making up for the misalignment in the overall deformation of the garment. The outcome is achieved with a three-stage framework: 1) the semantically associated landmarks are estimated using the landmark localization model; 2) taking the landmarks as input, the warping model explicitly associates the corresponding parts of the garment and person for obtaining the local flow, thus refining the alignment in the global flow; 3) finally, a generator consumes the landmarks to better capture local semantics and control the try-on results. Moreover, we propose a new landmark dataset with a unified labelling rule of landmarks for diverse styles of garments. Extensive experimental results on popular datasets demonstrate that SALVTON can handle misalignment and outperform state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. The dataset is available on https://modelscope.cn/datasets/damo/SAL-HG/summary.

        This paper presents a neural incremental Structure-from-Motion (SfM) approach, Level-S

fM, which estimates the camera poses and scene geometry from a set of uncalibrated images by learning coordinate MLPs for the implicit surfaces and the radiance fields from the established key-point correspondences. Our novel formulation poses some new challenges due to inevitable two-view and few-view configurations in the incremental SfM pipeline, which complicates the optimization of coordinate MLPs for volumetric neural rendering with unknown camera poses. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the strong inductive basis conveying in the 2D correspondences is promising to tackle those challenges by exploiting the relationship between the ray sampling schemes. Based on this, we revisit the pipeline of incremental SfM and renew the key components, including two-view geometry initialization, the camera poses registration, the 3D points triangulation, and Bundle Adjustment, with a fresh perspective based on neural implicit surfaces. By unifying the scene geometry in small MLP networks through coordinate MLPs, our Level-S

        ## [1638] Revisiting Rotation Averaging: Uncertainties and Robust Losses

        **Authors**: *Ganlin Zhang, Viktor Larsson, Daniel Barath*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01651](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01651)

        **Abstract**:

        In this paper, we revisit the rotation averaging problem applied in global Structure-from-Motion pipelines. We argue that the main problem of current methods is the minimized cost function that is only weakly connected with the input data via the estimated epipolar geometries. We propose to better model the underlying noise distributions by directly propagating the uncertainty from the point correspondences into the rotation averaging. Such uncertainties are obtained for free by considering the Jacobians of two-view refinements. Moreover, we explore integrating a variant of the MAGSAC loss into the rotation averaging problem, instead of using classical robust losses employed in current frameworks. The proposed method leads to results superior to baselines, in terms of accuracy, on large-scale public benchmarks. The code is public. https://github.com/zhangganlin/GlobalSfMpy

        ## [1639] SliceMatch: Geometry-Guided Aggregation for Cross-View Pose Estimation

        **Authors**: *Ted de Vries Lentsch, Zimin Xia, Holger Caesar, Julian F. P. Kooij*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01652](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01652)

        **Abstract**:

        This work addresses cross-view camera pose estimation, i.e., determining the 3-Degrees-of-Freedom camera pose of a given ground-level image w.r.t. an aerial image of the local area. We propose SliceMatch, which consists of ground and aerial feature extractors, feature aggregators, and a pose predictor. The feature extractors extract dense features from the ground and aerial images. Given a set of candidate camera poses, the feature aggregators construct a single ground descriptor and a set of pose-dependent aerial descriptors. Notably, our novel aerial feature aggregator has a cross-view attention module for ground-view guided aerial feature selection and utilizes the geometric projection of the ground camera's viewing frustum on the aerial image to pool features. The efficient construction of aerial descriptors is achieved using precomputed masks. SliceMatch is trained using contrastive learning and pose estimation is formulated as a similarity comparison between the ground descriptor and the aerial descriptors. Compared to the state-of-the-art, SliceMatch achieves a 19% lower median localization error on the VIGOR benchmark using the same VGG16 backbone at 150 frames per second, and a 50% lower error when using a ResNet50 backbone.

        **Abstract**:

        We present a new loss function for joint disparity and uncertainty estimation in deep stereo matching. Our work is motivated by the need for precise uncertainty estimates and the observation that multi-task learning often leads to improved performance in all tasks. We show that this can be achieved by requiring the distribution of uncertainty to match the distribution of disparity errors via a KL divergence term in the network's loss function. A differentiable soft-histogramming technique is used to approximate the distributions so that they can be used in the loss. We Experimentally assess the effectiveness of our approach and observe significant improvements in both disparity and uncertainty prediction on large datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lly00412/SEDNet.git.

        **Abstract**:

        Despite the remarkable advances in image matching and pose estimation, image-based localization of a camera in a temporally-varying outdoor environment is still a challenging problem due to huge appearance disparity between query and reference images caused by illumination, seasonal and structural changes. In this work, we propose to leverage additional sensors on a mobile phone, mainly GPS, compass, and gravity sensor, to solve this challenging problem. We show that these mobile sensors provide decent initial poses and effective constraints to reduce the searching space in image matching and final pose estimation. With the initial pose, we are also able to devise a direct 2D-3D matching network to efficiently establish 2D-3D correspondences instead of tedious 2D-2D matching in existing systems. As no public dataset exists for the studied problem, we collect a new dataset that provides a variety of mobile sensor data and significant scene appearance variations, and develop a system to acquire ground-truth poses for query images. We benchmark our method as well as several state-of-the-art baselines and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

        **Abstract**:

        We introduce a method that can learn to predict scenelevel implicit functions for 3D reconstruction from posed RGBD data. At test time, our system maps a previously unseen RGB image to a 3D reconstruction of a scene via implicit functions. While implicit functions for 3D reconstruction have often been tied to meshes, we show that we can train one using only a set of posed RGBD images. This setting may help 3D reconstruction unlock the sea of accelerometer+RGBD data that is coming with new phones. Our system, D2-DRDF, can match and sometimes outperform current methods that use mesh supervision and shows better robustness to sparse data.

        **Abstract**:

        Visual localization refers to the process of recovering camera pose from input image relative to a known scene, forming a cornerstone of numerous vision and robotics systems. While many algorithms utilize sparse 3D point cloud of the scene obtained via structure-from-motion (SfM) for localization, recent studies have raised privacy concerns by successfully revealing high-fidelity appearance of the scene from such sparse 3D representation. One prominent approach for bypassing this attack was to lift 3D points to randomly oriented 3D lines thereby hiding scene geometry, but latest work have shown such random line cloud has a critical statistical flaw that can be exploited to break through protection. In this work, we present an alternative lightweight strategy called Paired-Point Lifting (PPL) for constructing 3D line clouds. Instead of drawing one randomly oriented line per 3D point, PPL splits 3D points into pairs and joins each pair to form 3D lines. This seemingly simple strategy yields 3 benefits, i) new ambiguity in feature selection, ii) increased line cloud sparsity and iii) nontrivial distribution of 3D lines, all of which contributes to enhanced protection against privacy attacks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the strength of PPL in concealing scene details without compromising localization accuracy, unlocking the true potential of 3D line clouds.

We also introduce the Objectfolder Real dataset, including the multisensory measurements for 100 real-world household objects, building upon a newly designed pipeline for collecting the 3D meshes, videos, impact sounds, and tactile readings of real-world objects. We conduct systematic benchmarking on both the 1,000 multisensory neural objects from Objectfolder, and the real multisensory data from Objectfolder Real. Our results demonstrate the importance of multisensory perception and reveal the respective roles of vision, audio, and touch for different object-centric learning tasks. By publicly releasing our dataset and benchmark suite, we hope to catalyze and enable new research in multisensory object-centric learning in computer vision, robotics, and beyond.

        **Abstract**:

        Shape from Polarization (SfP) aims to recover surface normal using the polarization cues of light. The accuracy of existing SfP methods is affected by two main problems. First, the ambiguity of polarization cues partially results in false normal estimation. Second, the widely-used assumption about orthographic projection is too ideal. To solve these problems, we propose the first approach that com-bines deep learning and stereo polarization information to recover not only normal but also disparity. Specifically, for the ambiguity problem, we design a Shape Consistency-based Mask Prediction (SCMP) module. It exploits the inherent consistency between normal and disparity to identify the areas with false normal estimation. We replace the unreliable features enclosed by these areas with new features extracted by global attention mechanism. As to the orthographic projection problem, we propose a novel Viewing Direction-aided Positional Encoding (VDPE) strategy. This strategy is based on the unique pixel-viewing direction encoding, and thus enables our neural network to handle the non-orthographic projection. In addition, we establish a real-world stereo SfP dataset that contains various object categories and illumination conditions. Experiments showed that compared with existing SfP methods, our approach is more accurate. Moreover, our approach shows higher robustness to light variation.

        **Abstract**:

        Inferring the structure of 3D scenes from 2D observations is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recently popularized approaches based on neural scene representations have achieved tremendous impact and have been applied across a variety of applications. One of the major remaining challenges in this space is training a single model which can provide latent representations which effectively generalize beyond a single scene. Scene Representation Transformer (SRT) has shown promise in this direction, but scaling it to a larger set of diverse scenes is challenging and necessitates accurately posed ground truth data. To address this problem, we propose RUST (Really Unposed Scene representation Transformer), a pose-free approach to novel view synthesis trained on RGB images alone. Our main insight is that one can train a Pose Encoder that peeks at the target image and learns a latent pose embedding which is used by the decoder for view synthesis. We perform an empirical investigation into the learned latent pose structure and show that it allows meaningful test-time camera transformations and accurate explicit pose readouts. Perhaps surprisingly, RUST achieves similar quality as methods which have access to perfect camera pose, thereby unlocking the potential for large-scale training of amortized neural scene representations.

        **Abstract**:

        Geometric camera calibration is often required for applications that understand the perspective of the image. We propose Perspective Fields as a representation that models the local perspective properties of an image. Perspective Fields contain per-pixel information about the camera view, parameterized as an Up-vector and a Latitude value. This representation has a number of advantages; it makes minimal assumptions about the camera model and is invariant or equivariant to common image editing operations like cropping, warping, and rotation. It is also more interpretable and aligned with human perception. We train a neural network to predict Perspective Fields and the predicted Perspective Fields can be converted to calibration parameters easily. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach under various scenarios compared with camera calibration-based methods and show example applications in image compositing.

        **Abstract**:

        We propose VisFusion, a visibility-aware online 3D scene reconstruction approach from posed monocular videos. In particular, we aim to reconstruct the scene from volumetric features. Unlike previous reconstruction methods which aggregate features for each voxel from input views without considering its visibility, we aim to improve the feature fusion by explicitly inferring its visibility from a similarity matrix, computed from its projected features in each image pair. Following previous works, our model is a coarse-to-fine pipeline including a volume sparsification process. Different from their works which sparsify voxels globally with a fixed occupancy threshold, we perform the sparsification on a local feature volume along each visual ray to preserve at least one voxel per ray for more fine details. The sparse local volume is then fused with a global one for online reconstruction. We further propose to predict TSDF in a coarse-to-fine manner by learning its residuals across scales leading to better TSDF predictions. Experimental results on benchmarks show that our method can achieve superior performance with more scene details. Code is available at: https://github.com/huiyugao/VisFusion

        **Abstract**:

        Line segments are ubiquitous in our human-made world and are increasingly used in vision tasks. They are complementary to feature points thanks to their spatial extent and the structural information they provide. Traditional line detectors based on the image gradient are extremely fast and accurate, but lack robustness in noisy images and challenging conditions. Their learned counterparts are more repeatable and can handle challenging images, but at the cost of a lower accuracy and a bias towards wireframe lines. We propose to combine traditional and learned approaches to get the best of both worlds: an accurate and robust line detector that can be trained in the wild without ground truth lines. Our new line segment detector, DeepLSD, processes images with a deep network to generate a line attraction field, before converting it to a surrogate image gradient magnitude and angle, which is then fed to any existing handcrafted line detector. Additionally, we propose a new optimization tool to refine line segments based on the attraction field and vanishing points. This refinement improves the accuracy of current deep detectors by a large margin. We demonstrate the performance of our method on low-level line detection metrics, as well as on several downstream tasks using multiple challenging datasets.

        **Abstract**:

        Based on the Manhattan World assumption, most existing indoor layout estimation schemes focus on recovering layouts from vertically compressed 1D sequences. However, the compression procedure confuses the semantics of different planes, yielding inferior performance with ambiguous interpretability. To address this issue, we propose to disentangle this 1D representation by pre-segmenting orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) planes from a complex scene, explicitly capturing the geometric cues for indoor layout estimation. Considering the symmetry between the floor boundary and ceiling boundary, we also design a soft-flipping fusion strategy to assist the pre-segmentation. Besides, we present a feature assembling mechanism to effectively integrate shallow and deep features with distortion distribution awareness. To compensate for the potential errors in pre-segmentation, we further leverage triple attention to reconstruct the disentangled sequences for better performance. Experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate our superiority over existing SoTA solutions, especially on the 3DIoU metric. The code is available at https://github.com/zhijieshen-bjtu/DOPNet.

        **Abstract**:

        Neural-network-based single image depth prediction (SIDP) is a challenging task where the goal is to predict the scene's per-pixel depth at test time. Since the problem, by definition, is illposed, the fundamental goal is to come up with an approach that can reliably model the scene depth from a set of training examples. In the pursuit of perfect depth estimation, most existing state-of-the-art learning techniques predict a single scalar depth value per-pixel. Yet, it is well-known that the trained model has accuracy limits and can predict imprecise depth. Therefore, an SIDP approach must be mindful of the expected depth variations in the model's prediction at test time. Accordingly, we introduce an approach that performs continuous modeling of per-pixel depth, where we can predict and reason about the per-pixel depth and its distribution. To this end, we model per-pixel scene depth using a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Moreover, contrary to the existing uncertainty modeling methods‚Äîin the same spirit, where per-pixel depth is assumed to be independent, we introduce per-pixel covariance modeling that encodes its depth dependency w.r.t. all the scene points. Unfortunately, per-pixel depth covariance modeling leads to a computationally expensive continuous loss function, which we solve efficiently using the learned low-rank approximation of the overall covariance matrix. Notably, when tested on benchmark datasets such as KITTI, NYU, and SUN-RGB-D, the SIDP model obtained by optimizing our loss function shows state-of-the-art results. Our method's accuracy (named MG) is among the top on the KITTI depth-prediction benchmark leaderboard

        **Abstract**:

        Despite the proliferation of ultra wide-angle lenses on smartphone cameras, such lenses often come with severe image distortion (e.g. curved linear structure, unnaturally skewed faces). Most existing rectification methods adopt a global warping transformation to undistort the input wideangle image, yet their performances are not entirely satisfactory, leaving many unwanted residue distortions uncorrected or at the sacrifice of the intended wide FoV (field- of-view). This paper proposes a new method to tackle these challenges. Specifically, we derive a locally-adaptive polardomain conformal mapping to rectify a wide-angle image. Parameters of the mapping are found automatically by analyzing image contents via deep neural networks. Experiments on a large number of photos have confirmed the superior performance of the proposed method compared with all available previous methods.

        Traditional focal stack methods require multiple shots to capture images focused at different distances of the same scene, which cannot be applied to dynamic scenes well. Generating a high-quality all-in-focus image from a single shot is challenging, due to the highly ill-posed nature of the single-image defocus and deblurring problem. In this paper, to restore an all-in-focus image, we propose the event focal stack which is defined as event streams captured during a continuous focal sweep. Given an RGB image focused at an arbitrary distance, we explore the high temporal resolution of event streams, from which we automatically select refocusing timestamps and reconstruct corresponding refocused images with events to form a focal stack. Guided by the neighbouring events around the selected timestamps, we can merge the focal stack with proper weights and restore a sharp all-in-focus image. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

        **Authors**: *Yisu Zhang, Jianke Zhu, Lixiang Lin*

        **Abstract**:

        Deep learning-based multi-view stereo has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reconstructing the complete geometrically-detailed objects from multi-views. Most of the existing approaches only estimate the pixel-wise depth value by minimizing the gap between the predicted point and the intersection of ray and surface, which usually ignore the surface topology. It is essential to the textureless regions and surface boundary that cannot be properly reconstructed. To address this issue, we suggest to take advantage of point-to-surface distance so that the model is able to perceive a wider range of surfaces. To this end, we predict the distance volume from cost volume to estimate the signed distance of points around the surface. Our proposed RA-MVSNet is patch-awared, since the perception range is enhanced by associating hypothetical planes with a patch of surface. Therefore, it could increase the completion of textureless regions and reduce the outliers at the boundary. Moreover, the mesh topologies with fine details can be generated by the introduced distance volume. Comparing to the conventional deep learning-based multi-view stereo methods, our proposed RA-MVSNet approach obtains more complete reconstruction results by taking advantage of signed distance supervision. The experiments on both the DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art results.

        **Abstract**:

        In this paper, we aim to learn a semantic radiance field from multiple scenes that is accurate, efficient and generalizable. While most existing NeRFs target at the tasks of neural scene rendering, image synthesis and multi-view reconstruction, there are a few attempts such as Semantic-NeRF that explore to learn high-level semantic understanding with the NeRF structure. However, Semantic-NeRF simultaneously learns color and semantic label from a single ray with multiple heads, where the single ray fails to provide rich semantic information. As a result, Semantic NeRF relies on positional encoding and needs to train one specific model for each scene. To address this, we propose Semantic Ray (S-Ray) to fully exploit semantic information along the ray direction from its multi-view reprojections. As directly performing dense attention over multi-view reprojected rays would suffer from heavy computational cost, we design a Cross-Reprojection Attention module with consecutive intra-view radial and cross-view sparse attentions, which decomposes contextual information along reprojected rays and cross multiple views and then collects dense connections by stacking the modules. Experiments show that our S-Ray is able to learn from multiple scenes, and it presents strong generalization ability to adapt to unseen scenes. Project page: https://liuff19.github.io/S-Ray/.

        **Abstract**:

        This paper presents OmniCity, a new dataset for omnipotent city understanding from multi-level and multi-view images. More precisely, OmniCity contains multi-view satellite images as well as street-level panorama and mono-view images, constituting over 100K pixel-wise annotated images that are well-aligned and collected from 25K geo-locations in New York City. To alleviate the substantial pixel-wise annotation efforts, we propose an efficient street-viewimage annotation pipeline that leverages the existing label maps of satellite view and the transformation relations between different views (satellite, panorama, and mono-view). With the new OmniCity dataset, we provide benchmarks for a variety of tasks including building footprint extraction, height estimation, and building plane/instance/fine-grained segmentation. Compared with existing multi-level and multi-view benchmarks, OmniCity contains a larger number of images with richer annotation types and more views, provides more benchmark results of state-of-the-art models, and introduces a new task for fine-grained building instance segmentation on street-level panorama images. Moreover, OmniCity provides new problem settings for existing tasks, such as cross-view image matching, synthesis, segmentation, detection, etc., and facilitates the developing of new methods for large-scale city understanding, reconstruction, and simulation. The OmniCity dataset as well as the benchmarks will be released at https://city-super.github.io/mnicity/.

        **Abstract**:

        We present ESLAM, an efficient implicit neural representation method for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). ESLAM reads RGB-D frames with unknown camera poses in a sequential manner and incrementally reconstructs the scene representation while estimating the current camera position in the scene. We incorporate the latest advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into a SLAM system, resulting in an efficient and accurate dense visual SLAM method. Our scene representation consists of multi-scale axis-aligned perpendicular feature planes and shallow decoders that, for each point in the continuous space, decode the interpolated features into Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF) and RGB values. Our extensive experiments on three standard datasets, Replica, ScanNet, and TUM RGB-D show that ESLAM improves the accuracy of 3D reconstruction and camera localization of state-of-the-art dense visual SLAM methods by more than 50%, while it runs up to √ó10 faster and does not require any pre-training.

        **Abstract**:

        Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging aims at reconstructing the location, shape, albedo, and surface normal of the hidden object around the corner with measured transient data. Due to its strong potential in various fields, it has drawn much attention in recent years. However, long exposure time is not always available for applications such as auto-driving, which hinders the practical use of NLOS imaging. Although scanning fewer points can reduce the total measurement time, it also brings the problem of imaging quality degradation. This paper proposes a general learning-based pipeline for increasing imaging quality with only a few scanning points. We tailor a neural network to learn the operator that recovers a high spatial resolution signal. Experiments on synthetic and measured data indicate that the proposed method provides faithful reconstructions of the hidden scene under both confocal and non-confocal settings. Compared with original measurements, the acquisition of our approach is 16 times faster while maintaining similar reconstruction quality. Besides, the proposed pipeline can be applied directly to existing optical systems and imaging algorithms as a plug-in-and-play module. We believe the proposed pipeline is powerful in increasing the frame rate in NLOS video imaging.

        **Abstract**:

        Next generation cellular networks will implement radio sensing functions alongside customary communications, thereby enabling unprecedented worldwide sensing coverage outdoors. Deep learning has revolutionised computer vision but has had limited application to radio perception tasks, in part due to lack of systematic datasets and benchmarks dedicated to the study of the performance and promise of radio sensing. To address this gap, we present MaxRay: a synthetic radio-visual dataset and benchmark that facilitate precise target localisation in radio. We further propose to learn to localise targets in radio without supervision by extracting self-coordinates from radio-visual correspondence. We use such self-supervised coordinates to train a radio localiser network. We characterise our performance against a number of state-of-the-art baselines. Our results indicate that accurate radio target localisation can be automatically learned from paired radio-visual data without labels, which is important for empirical data. This opens the door for vast data scalability and may prove key to realising the promise of robust radio sensing atop a unified communication-perception cellular infrastructure. Dataset will be hosted on IEEE DataPort.

        **Abstract**:

        The performance of modern object detectors drops when the test distribution differs from the training one. Most of the methods that address this focus on object appearance changes caused by, e.g., different illumination conditions, or gaps between synthetic and real images. Here, by contrast, we tackle geometric shifts emerging from variations in the image capture process, or due to the constraints of the environment causing differences in the apparent geometry of the content itself. We introduce a self-training approach that learns a set of geometric transformations to minimize these shifts without leveraging any labeled data in the new domain, nor any information about the cameras. We evaluate our method on two different shifts, i.e., a camera's field of view (FoV) change and a viewpoint change. Our results evidence that learning geometric transformations helps detectors to perform better in the target domains.

        **Abstract**:

        Monocular 3D lane detection is a challenging task due to its lack of depth information. A popular solution is to first transform the front-viewed (FV) images or features into the bird-eye-view (BEV) space with inverse perspective mapping (IPM) and detect lanes from BEV features. However, the reliance of IPM on flat ground assumption and loss of context information make it inaccurate to restore 3D information from BEV representations. An attempt has been made to get rid of BEV and predict 3D lanes from FV representations directly, while it still underperforms other BEV-based methods given its lack of structured representation for 3D lanes. In this paper, we define 3D lane anchors in the 3D space and propose a BEV-free method named Anchor3DLane to predict 3D lanes directly from FV representations. 3D lane anchors are projected to the FV features to extract their features which contain both good structural and context information to make accurate predictions. In addition, we also develop a global optimization method that makes use of the equal-width property between lanes to reduce the lateral error of predictions. Extensive experiments on three popular 3D lane detection benchmarks show that our Anchor3DLane outperforms previous BEV-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performances.

        **Abstract**:

        Bird'View (BEV) 3D Object Detection is a crucial multi-view technique for autonomous driving systems. Recently, plenty of works are proposed, following a similar paradigm consisting of three essential components, i.e., camera feature extraction, BEV feature construction, and task heads. Among the three components, BEV feature construction is BEV-specific compared with 2D tasks. Existing methods aggregate the multi-view camera features to the flattened grid in order to construct the BEV feature. However, flattening the BEV space along the height dimension fails to emphasize the informative features of different heights. For example, the barrier is located at a low height while the truck is located at a high height. In this paper, we propose a novel method named BEV Slice Attention Network (BEV-SAN) for exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of different heights. Instead of flattening the BEV space, we first sample along the height dimension to build the global and local BEV slices. Then, the features of BEV slices are aggregated from the camera features and merged by the attention mechanism. Finally, we fuse the merged local and global BEV features by a transformer to generate the final feature map for task heads. The purpose of local BEV slices is to emphasize informative heights. In order to find them, we further propose a LiDAR-guided sampling strategy to leverage the statistical distribution of LiDAR to determine the heights of local slices. Compared with uniform sampling, LiDAR-guided sampling can determine more informative heights. We conduct detailed experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of BEV-SAN. Code will be released.

        **Abstract**:

        Stereo-based 3D object detection, which aims at detecting 3D objects with stereo cameras, shows great potential in low-cost deployment compared to LiDAR-based methods and excellent performance compared to monocular-based algorithms. However, the impressive performance of stereo-based 3D object detection is at the huge cost of high-quality manual annotations, which are hardly attainable for any given scene. Semi-supervised learning, in which limited annotated data and numerous unannotated data are required to achieve a satisfactory model, is a promising method to address the problem of data deficiency. In this work, we propose to achieve semi-supervised learning for stereo-based 3D object detection through pseudo annotation generation from a temporal-aggregated teacher model, which temporally accumulates knowledge from a student model. To facilitate a more stable and accurate depth estimation, we introduce Temporal-Aggregation-Guided (TAG) disparity consistency, a cross-view disparity consistency constraint between the teacher model and the student model for robust and improved depth estimation. To mitigate noise in pseudo annotation generation, we propose a cross-view agreement strategy, in which pseudo annotations should attain high degree of agreements between 3D and 2D views, as well as between binocular views. We perform extensive experiments on the KITTI 3D dataset to demonstrate our proposed method's capability in leveraging a huge amount of unannotated stereo images to attain significantly improved detection results.

        **Abstract**:

        Monocular 3D object detection has become a mainstream approach in automatic driving for its easy application. A prominent advantage is that it does not need Li-DAR point clouds during the inference. However, most current methods still rely on 3D point cloud data for labeling the ground truths used in the training phase. This inconsistency between the training and inference makes it hard to utilize the large-scale feedback data and increases the data collection expenses. To bridge this gap, we propose a new weakly supervised monocular 3D objection detection method, which can train the model with only 2D labels marked on images. To be specific, we explore three types of consistency in this task, i.e. the projection, multi-view and direction consistency, and design a weakly-supervised architecture based on these consistencies. Moreover, we propose a new 2D direction labeling method in this task to guide the model for accurate rotation direction prediction. Experiments show that our weakly-supervised method achieves comparable performance with some fully supervised methods. When used as a pre-training method, our model can significantly outperform the corresponding fully-supervised baseline with only 1/3 3D labels.

        **Abstract**:

        Mobile monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D) (e.g., on a vehicle, a drone, or a robot) is an important yet challenging task. Existing transformer-based offline Mono3D models adopt grid-based vision tokens, which is suboptimal when using coarse tokens due to the limited available computational power. In this paper, we propose an online Mono3D framework, called MonoATT, which leverages a novel vision transformer with heterogeneous tokens of varying shapes and sizes to facilitate mobile Mono3D. The core idea of MonoATT is to adaptively assign finer tokens to areas of more significance before utilizing a transformer to enhance Mono3D. To this end, we first use prior knowledge to design a scoring network for selecting the most important areas of the image, and then propose a token clustering and merging network with an attention mechanism to gradually merge tokens around the selected areas in multiple stages. Finally, a pixel-level feature map is reconstructed from heterogeneous tokens before employing a SOTA Mono3D detector as the underlying detection core. Experiment results on the real-world KITTI dataset demonstrate that MonoATT can effectively improve the Mono3D accuracy for both near and far objects and guarantee low latency. MonoATT yields the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin and is ranked number one on the KITTI 3D benchmark.

        **Abstract**:

        We tackle the task of Azimuth (angular dimension) super-resolution for Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. FMCW MIMO radar is widely used in autonomous driving alongside Lidar and RGB cameras. However, compared to Lidar, MIMO radar is usually of low resolution due to hardware size restrictions. For example, achieving 1¬∞ azimuth resolution requires at least 100 receivers, but a single MIMO device usually supports at most 12 receivers. Having limitations on the number of receivers is problematic since a high-resolution measurement of azimuth angle is essential for estimating the location and velocity of objects. To improve the azimuth resolution of MIMO radar, we propose a light, yet efficient, Analog-to-Digital super-resolution model (ADC-SR) that predicts or hallucinates additional radar signals using signals from only a few receivers. Compared with the baseline models that are applied to processed radar Range-Azimuth-Doppler (RAD) maps, we show that our ADC-SR method that processes raw ADC signals achieves comparable performance with 98% (50 times) fewer parameters. We also propose a hybrid super-resolution model (Hybrid-SR) combining our ADC-SR with a standard RAD super-resolution model, and show that performance can be improved by a large margin. Experiments on our Pitt-Radar dataset and the RADIal dataset validate the importance of leveraging raw radar ADC signals. To assess the value of our super-resolution model for autonomous driving, we also perform object detection on the results of our super-resolution model and find that our super-resolution model improves detection performance by around 4% in mAP. The Pitt-Radar and the code will be released at the link.

        **Abstract**:

        Self-driving vehicles rely on urban street maps for autonomous navigation. In this paper, we introduce Pix2Map, a method for inferring urban street map topology directly from ego-view images, as needed to continually update and expand existing maps. This is a challenging task, as we need to infer a complex urban road topology directly from raw image data. The main insight of this paper is that this problem can be posed as cross-modal retrieval by learning a joint, cross-modal embedding space for images and existing maps, represented as discrete graphs that encode the topological layout of the visual surroundings. We conduct our experimental evaluation using the Argoverse dataset and show that it is indeed possible to accurately retrieve street maps corresponding to both seen and unseen roads solely from image data. Moreover, we show that our retrieved maps can be used to update or expand existing maps and even show proof-of-concept results for visual localization and image retrieval from spatial graphs.

        **Abstract**:

        LiDAR-camera fusion methods have shown impressive performance in 3D object detection. Recent advanced multi-modal methods mainly perform global fusion, where image features and point cloud features are fused across the whole scene. Such practice lacks fine-grained region-level information, yielding suboptimal fusion performance. In this paper, we present the novel Local-to-Global fusion network (LoGoNet), which performs LiDAR-camerafusion at both local and global levels. Concretely, the Global Fusion (GoF) of LoGoNet is built upon previous literature, while we exclusively use point centroids to more precisely represent the position of voxel features, thus achieving better crossmodal alignment. As to the Local Fusion (LoF), we first divide each proposal into uniform grids and then project these grid centers to the images. The image features around the projected grid points are sampled to be fused with position-decorated point cloud features, maximally uti-lizing the rich contextual information around the proposals. The Feature Dynamic Aggregation (FDA) module is further proposed to achieve information interaction between these locally and globally fused features, thus producing more informative multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) and KITTI datasets show that LoGoNet outperforms all state-of-the-art 3D detection methods. Notably, LoGoNet ranks 1st on Waymo 3D object detection leaderboard and obtains 81.02 mAPH (L2) detection performance. It is noteworthy that, for the first time, the detection performance on three classes surpasses 80 APH (L2) simultaneously. Code will be available at https://github.com/sankin97/LoGoNet.

        **Abstract**:

        High-definition (HD) semantic maps are crucial for autonomous vehicles navigating urban environments. Traditional offline HD maps, created through labor-intensive manual annotation processes, are both costly and incapable of accommodating timely updates. Recently, researchers have proposed inferring local maps based on online sensor observations; however, this approach is constrained by the sensor perception range and is susceptible to occlusions. In this work, we propose Neural Map Prior (NMP), a neural representation of global maps that facilitates automatic global map updates and improves local map inference performance. To incorporate the strong map prior into local map inference, we employ cross-attention that dynamically captures correlations between current features and prior features. For updating the global neural map prior, we use a learning-based fusion module to guide the network in fusing features from previous traversals. This design allows the network to capture a global neural map prior during sequential online map predictions. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our frame-work is highly compatible with various map segmentation and detection architectures and considerably strengthens map prediction performance, even under adverse weather conditions and across longer horizons. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first learning-based system for constructing a global map prior.

        LiDAR-based 3D point cloud recognition has benefited various applications. Without specially considering the LiDAR point distribution, most current methods suffer from information disconnection and limited receptive field, especially for the sparse distant points. In this work, we study the varying-sparsity distribution of LiDAR points and present SphereFormer to directly aggregate information from dense close points to the sparse distant ones. We design radial window self-attention that partitions the space into multiple non-overlapping narrow and long windows. It overcomes the disconnection issue and enlarges the receptive field smoothly and dramatically, which significantly boosts the performance of sparse distant points. Moreover, to fit the narrow and long windows, we propose exponential splitting to yield fine-grained position encoding and dynamic feature selection to increase model representation ability. Notably, our method ranks 1

        ## [1671] Density-Insensitive Unsupervised Domain Adaption on 3D Object Detection

        **Abstract**:

        3D object detection from point clouds is crucial in safety-critical autonomous driving. Although many works have made great efforts and achieved significant progress on this task, most of them suffer from expensive annotation cost and poor transferability to unknown data due to the domain gap. Recently, few works attempt to tackle the domain gap in objects, but still fail to adapt to the gap of varying beam-densities between two domains, which is critical to mitigate the characteristic differences of the LiDAR collectors. To this end, we make the attempt to propose a density-insensitive domain adaption framework to address the density-induced domain gap. In particular, we first introduce Random Beam Re-Sampling (RBRS) to enhance the robustness of 3D detectors trained on the source domain to the varying beam-density. Then, we take this pre-trained detector as the backbone model, and feed the unlabeled target domain data into our newly designed task-specific teacher-student framework for predicting its high-quality pseudo labels. To further adapt the property of density-insensitivity into the target domain, we feed the teacher and student branches with the same sample of different densities, and propose an Object Graph Alignment (OGA) module to construct two object-graphs between the two branches for enforcing the consistency in both the attribute and relation of cross-density objects. Experimental results on three widely adopted 3D object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed domain adaption method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially over varying-density data.

        **Abstract**:

        In order to deal with the sparse and unstructured raw point clouds, most LiDAR based 3D object detection research focuses on designing dedicated local point aggregators for fine-grained geometrical modeling. In this paper, we revisit the local point aggregators from the perspective of allocating computational resources. We find that the simplest pillar based models perform surprisingly well considering both accuracy and latency. Additionally, we show that minimal adaptions from the success of 2D object detection, such as enlarging receptive field, significantly boost the performance. Extensive experiments reveal that our pillar based networks with modernized designs in terms of architecture and training render the state-of-the-art performance on two popular benchmarks: Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes. Our results challenge the common intuition that detailed geometry modeling is essential to achieve high performance for 3D object detection.

        **Abstract**:

        The modern machine learning-based technologies have shown considerable potential in automatic radar scene understanding. Among these efforts, radar semantic segmentation (RSS) can provide more refined and detailed information including the moving objects and background clutters within the effective receptive field of the radar. Motivated by the success of convolutional networks in various visual computing tasks, these networks have also been introduced to solve RSS task. However, neither the regular convolution operation nor the modified ones are specific to interpret radar signals. The receptive fields of existing convolutions are defined by the object presentation in optical signals, but these two signals have different perception mechanisms. In classic radar signal processing, the object signature is detected according to a local peak response, i.e., CFAR detection. Inspired by this idea, we redefine the receptive field of the convolution operation as the peak receptive field (PRF) and propose the peak convolution operation (PeakConv) to learn the object signatures in an end-to-end network. By incorporating the proposed PeakConv layers into the encoders, our RSS network can achieve better segmentation results compared with other SoTA methods on a multi-view real-measured dataset collected from an FMCW radar. Our code for PeakConv is available at https://github.com/zlw9161/PKC.

        **Abstract**:

        With the success of the 3D deep learning models, various perception technologies for autonomous driving have been developed in the LiDAR domain. While these models perform well in the trained source domain, they struggle in unseen domains with a domain gap. In this paper, we propose a single domain generalization method for LiDAR semantic segmentation (DGLSS) that aims to ensure good performance not only in the source domain but also in the unseen domain by learning only on the source domain. We mainly focus on generalizing from a dense source domain and target the domain shift from different LiDAR sensor configurations and scene distributions. To this end, we augment the domain to simulate the unseen domains by randomly subsampling the LiDAR scans. With the augmented domain, we introduce two constraints for generalizable representation learning: sparsity invariant feature consistency (SIFC) and semantic correlation consistency (SCC). The SIFC aligns sparse internal features of the source domain with the augmented domain based on the feature affinity. For SCC, we constrain the correlation between class prototypes to be similar for every LiDAR scan. We also establish a standardized training and evaluation setting for DGLSS. With the proposed evaluation setting, our method showed improved performance in the unseen domains compared to other baselines. Even without access to the target domain, our method performed better than the domain adaptation method. The code is available at https://github.com/gzgzys9887/DGLSS.

        **Abstract**:

        Understanding the motion behavior of dynamic environments is vital for autonomous driving, leading to increasing attention in class-agnostic motion prediction in LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes can often be decomposed into mobile foregrounds and static backgrounds, which enables us to associate motion understanding with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we study a novel weakly supervised motion prediction paradigm, where fully or partially (1 %, 0.1%) annotated foreground/background binary masks are used for supervision, rather than using expensive motion annotations. To this end, we propose a two-stage weakly supervised approach, where the segmentation model trained with the incomplete binary masks in Stage1 will facilitate the self-supervised learning of the motion prediction network in Stage2 by estimating possible moving foregrounds in advance. Furthermore, for robust self-supervised motion learning, we design a Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss by exploiting multi-frame information and explicitly suppressing potential outliers. Comprehensive experiments show that, with fully or partially binary masks as supervision, our weakly supervised models surpass the self-supervised models by a large margin and perform on par with some supervised ones. This further demonstrates that our approach achieves a good compromise between annotation effort and performance.

<inf xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">4</inf>
) is the chief contributor to global climate change. Recent Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) has been very useful in quantitative mapping of methane emissions. Existing methods for analyzing this data are sensitive to local terrain conditions, often require manual inspection from domain experts, prone to significant error and hence are not scalable. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end spectral absorption wavelength aware transformer network, MethaneMapper, to detect and quantify the emissions. MethaneMapper introduces two novel modules that help to locate the most relevant methane plume regions in the spectral domain and uses them to localize these accurately. Thorough evaluation shows that MethaneMapper achieves 0.63 mAP in detection and reduces the model size (by 5√ó) compared to the current state of the art. In addition, we also introduce a large-scale dataset of methane plume segmentation mask for over 1200 AVIRIS-NG flight lines from 2015‚Äì2022. It contains over 4000 methane plume sites. Our dataset will provide researchers the opportunity to develop and advance new methods for tackling this challenging green-house gas detection problem with significant broader social impact.

        **Abstract**:

        We study the problem of 3D semantic segmentation from raw point clouds. Unlike existing methods which primarily rely on a large amount of human annotations for training neural networks, we propose the first purely unsupervised method, called GrowSP, to successfully identify complex semantic classes for every point in 3D scenes, without needing any type of human labels or pretrained models. The key to our approach is to discover 3D semantic elements via progressive growing of superpoints. Our method consists of three major components, 1) the feature extractor to learn per-point features from input point clouds, 2) the superpoint constructor to progressively grow the sizes of superpoints, and 3) the semantic primitive clustering module to group superpoints into semantic elements for the final semantic segmentation. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple datasets, demonstrating superior performance over all unsupervised baselines and approaching the classic fully-supervised PointNet. We hope our work could inspire more advanced methods for unsupervised 3D semantic learning.

        **Abstract**:

        3D shape completion from point clouds is a challenging task, especially from scans of real-world objects. Considering the paucity of 3D shape ground truths for real scans, existing works mainly focus on benchmarking this task on synthetic data, e.g. 3D computer-aided design models. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real data limits the generalizability of these methods. Thus, we propose a new task, SCoDA, for the domain adaptation of real scan shape completion from synthetic data. A new dataset, ScanSalon, is contributed with a bunch of elaborate 3D models created by skillful artists according to scans. To address this new task, we propose a novel cross-domain feature fusion method for knowledge transfer and a novel volume-consistent self-training framework for robust learning from real data. Extensive experiments prove our method is effective to bring an improvement of 6%~7% mIoU.

        **Abstract**:

        Training deep models for semantic scene completion (SSC) is challenging due to the sparse and incomplete input, a large quantity of objects of diverse scales as well as the inherent label noise for moving objects. To address the above-mentioned problems, we propose the following three solutions: 1) Redesigning the completion sub-network. We design a novel completion sub-network, which consists of several Multi-Path Blocks (MPBs) to aggregate multi-scale features and is free from the lossy downsampling operations. 2) Distilling rich knowledge from the multi-frame model. We design a novel knowledge distillation objective, dubbed Dense-to-Sparse Knowledge Distillation (DSKD). It transfers the dense, relation-based semantic knowledge from the multi-frame teacher to the single-frame student, significantly improving the representation learning of the single-frame model. 3) Completion label rectification. We propose a simple yet effective label rectification strategy, which uses off-the-shelf panoptic segmentation labels to remove the traces of dynamic objects in completion labels, greatly improving the performance of deep models especially for those moving objects. Extensive experiments are conducted in two public SSC benchmarks, i.e., SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS. Our SCPNet ranks 1st on SemanticKITTI semantic scene completion challenge and surpasses the competitive S3CNet [3] by 7.2 mIoU. SCP-Net also outperforms previous completion algorithms on the SemanticPOSS dataset. Besides, our method also achieves competitive results on SemanticKITTI semantic segmentation tasks, showing that knowledge learned in the scene completion is beneficial to the segmentation task.

        **Abstract**:

        Although different approaches have been proposed for 3D point cloud-related tasks, few-shot learning (FSL) of 3D point clouds still remains under-explored. In FSL, un-like traditional supervised learning, the classes of training and test data do not overlap, and a model needs to rec-ognize unseen classes from only a few samples. Existing FSL methods for 3D point clouds employ point-based models as their backbone. Yet, based on our extensive experiments and analysis, we first show that using a point-based backbone is not the most suitable FSL approach, since (i) a large number of points' features are discarded by the max pooling operation used in 3D point-based backbones, decreasing the ability of representing shape information; (ii) point-based backbones are sensitive to occlusion. To address these issues, we propose employing a projection-and 2D Convolutional Neural Network-based backbone, referred to as the ViewNet, for FSL from 3D point clouds. Our approach first projects a 3D point cloud onto six different views to alleviate the issue of missing points. Also, to generate more descriptive and distinguishing features, we propose View Pooling, which combines different projected plane combinations into five groups and performs max-pooling on each of them. The experiments performed on the ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN and ModelNet40-C datasets, with cross validation, show that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, compared to traditional image classification backbones, such as ResNet, the proposed ViewNet can extract more distinguishing features from multiple views of a point cloud. We also show that ViewNet can be used as a backbone with different FSL heads and provides improved performance compared to traditionally used backbones.

        **Abstract**:

        Recent work on 4D point cloud sequences has attracted a lot of attention. However, obtaining exhaustively labeled 4D datasets is often very expensive and laborious, so it is especially important to investigate how to utilize raw unlabeled data. However, most existing self-supervised point cloud representation learning methods only consider geometry from a static snapshot omitting the fact that sequential observations of dynamic scenes could reveal more comprehensive geometric details. To overcome such issues, this paper proposes a new 4D self-supervised pretraining method called Complete-to-Partial 4D Distillation. Our key idea is to formulate 4D self-supervised representation learning as a teacher-student knowledge distillation framework and let the student learn useful 4D representations with the guidance of the teacher. Experiments show that this approach significantly outperforms previous pre-training approaches on a wide range of 4D point cloud sequence understanding tasks.

        **Abstract**:

        Point cloud sampling is crucial for efficient large-scale point cloud analysis, where learning-to-sample methods have recently received increasing attention from the community for jointly training with downstream tasks. However, the abovementioned task-specific sampling methods usually fail to explore the geometries of objects in an explicit manner. In this paper, we introduce a new skeleton-aware learning-to-sample method by learning object skeletons as the prior knowledge to preserve the object geometry and topology information during sampling. Specifically, without labor-intensive annotations per object category, we first learn category-agnostic object skeletons via the medial axis transform definition in an unsupervised manner. With object skeleton, we then evaluate the histogram of the local feature size as the prior knowledge to formulate skeleton-aware sampling from a probabilistic perspective. Additionally, the proposed skeleton-aware sampling pipeline with the task network is thus end-to-end trainable by exploring the reparameterization trick. Extensive experiments on three popular downstream tasks, point cloud classification, retrieval, and reconstruction, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for efficient point cloud analysis.

        **Abstract**:

        Recent advances in 3D point cloud analysis bring a diverse set of network architectures to the field. However, the lack of a unified framework to interpret those networks makes any systematic comparison, contrast, or analysis challenging, and practically limits healthy development of the field. In this paper, we take the initiative to explore and propose a unified framework called PointMeta, to which the popular 3D point cloud analysis approaches could fit. This brings three benefits. First, it allows us to compare different approaches in a fair manner, and use quick experiments to verify any empirical observations or assumptions summarized from the comparison. Second, the big picture brought by PointMeta enables us to think across different components, and revisit common beliefs and key design decisions made by the popular approaches. Third, based on the learnings from the previous two analyses, by doing simple tweaks on the existing approaches, we are able to derive a basic building block, termed PointMetaBase. It shows very strong performance in efficiency and effectiveness through extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, and thus verifies the necessity and benefits of high-level interpretation, contrast, and comparison like PointMeta. In particular, PointMetaBase surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method by 0.7%/1.4/%2.1% mIoU with only 2%/11%/13% of the computation cost on the S3DIS datasets.

        **Abstract**:

        Deep neural networks on regular 1D lists (e.g., natural languages) and irregular 3D sets (e.g., point clouds) have made tremendous achievements. The key to natural language processing is to model words and their regular order dependency in texts. For point cloud understanding, the challenge is to understand the geometry via irregular point coordinates, in which point-feeding orders do not matter. However, there are a few kinds of data that exhibit both regular 1 D list and irregular 3D set structures, such as proteins and non-coding RNAs. In this paper, we refer to them as 3D point lists and propose a Transformer-style PointListNet to model them. First, PointListNet employs non-parametric distance-based attention because we find sometimes it is the distance, instead of the feature or type, that mainly determines how much two points, e.g., amino acids, are correlated in the micro world. Second, different from the vanilla Transformer that directly performs a simple linear transformation on inputs to generate values and does not explicitly model relative relations, our PointListNet integrates the 1D order and 3D Euclidean displacements into values. We conduct experiments on protein fold classification and enzyme reaction classification. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed PointListNet.

        **Abstract**:

        Learning distinctive point-wise features is critical for low-overlap point cloud registration. Recently, it has achieved huge success in incorporating Transformer into point cloud feature representation, which usually adopts a self-attention module to learn intra-point-cloud features first, then utilizes a cross-attention module to perform feature exchange between input point clouds. The advantage of Transformer models mainly benefits from the use of self-attention to capture the global correlations in feature space. However, these global correlations may involve ambiguity for point cloud registration task, especially in indoor low-overlap scenarios, because the correlations with an extensive range of non-overlapping points may degrade the feature distinctiveness. To address this issue, we present PEAL, a Prior-embedded Explicit Attention Learning model. By incorporating prior knowledge into the learning process, the points are divided into two parts. One includes points lying in the putative overlapping region and the other includes points located in the putative non-overlapping region. Then PEAL explicitly learns one-way attention with the putative overlapping points. This simplistic design attains surprising performance, significantly relieving the aforementioned feature ambiguity. Our method improves the Registration Recall by 6+% on the challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Feature Matching Recall, Inlier Ratio, and Registration Recall on both 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch.

        **Abstract**:

        It is vital to infer signed distance functions (SDFs) from 3D point clouds. The latest methods rely on generalizing the priors learned from large scale supervision. However, the learned priors do not generalize well to various geometric variations that are unseen during training, especially for extremely sparse point clouds. To resolve this issue, we present a neural network to directly infer SDFs from single sparse point clouds without using signed distance supervision, learned priors or even normals. Our insight here is to learn surface parameterization and SDFs inference in an end-to-end manner. To make up the sparsity, we leverage parameterized surfaces as a coarse surface sampler to provide many coarse surface estimations in training iterations, according to which we mine supervision and our thin plate splines (TPS) based network infers SDFs as smooth functions in a statistical way. Our method significantly improves the generalization ability and accuracy in unseen point clouds. Our experimental results show our advantages over the state-of-the-art methods in surface reconstruction for sparse point clouds under synthetic datasets and real scans.

        Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have shown remarkable capability in representing geometry with details. However, without signed distance supervision, it is still a challenge to infer SDFs from point clouds or multi-view images using neural networks. In this paper, we claim that gradient consistency in the field, indicated by the parallelism of level sets, is the key factor affecting the inference accuracy. Hence, we propose a level set alignment loss to evaluate the parallelism of level sets, which can be minimized to achieve better gradient consistency. Our novelty lies in that we can align all level sets to the zero level set by constraining gradients at queries and their projections on the zero level set in an adaptive way. Our insight is to propagate the zero level set to everywhere in the field through consistent gradients to eliminate uncertainty in the field that is caused by the discreteness of 3D point clouds or the lack of observations from multi-view images. Our proposed loss is a general term which can be used upon different methods to infer SDFs from 3D point clouds and multi-view images. Our numerical and visual comparisons demonstrate that our loss can significantly improve the accuracy of SDFs inferred from point clouds or multiview images under various benchmarks.

        ## [1688] Self-Supervised Learning for Multimodal Non-Rigid 3D Shape Matching

        **Authors**: *Dongliang Cao, Florian Bernard*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01701](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01701)

        **Abstract**:

        The matching of 3D shapes has been extensively studied for shapes represented as surface meshes, as well as for shapes represented as point clouds. While point clouds are a common representation of raw real-world 3D data (e.g. from laser scanners), meshes encode rich and expressive topological information, but their creation typically requires some form of (often manual) curation. In turn, methods that purely rely on point clouds are unable to meet the matching quality of mesh-based methods that utilise the additional topological structure. In this work we close this gap by introducing a self-supervised multimodal learning strategy that combines mesh-based functional map regularisation with a contrastive loss that couples mesh and point cloud data. Our shape matching approach allows to obtain intramodal correspondences for triangle meshes, complete point clouds, and partially observed point clouds, as well as correspondences across these data modalities. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on several challenging benchmark datasets even in comparison to recent supervised methods, and that our method reaches previously unseen cross-dataset generalisation ability. Our code is available at https://github.com/dongliangcao/Self-Supervised-Multimodal-Shape-Matching.

        **Abstract**:

        As a fundamental problem in computer vision, 3D point cloud registration (PCR) aims to seek the optimal pose to align a point cloud pair. In this paper, we present a 3D registration method with maximal cliques (MAC). The key insight is to loosen the previous maximum clique constraint, and mine more local consensus information in a graph for accurate pose hypotheses generation: 1) A compatibility graph is constructed to render the affinity relationship between initial correspondences. 2) We search for maximal cliques in the graph, each of which represents a consensus set. We perform node-guided clique selection then, where each node corresponds to the maximal clique with the greatest graph weight. 3) Transformation hypotheses are computed for the selected cliques by the SVD algorithm and the best hypothesis is used to perform registration. Extensive experiments on U3M, 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch and KITTI demonstrate that MAC effectively increases registration accuracy, outperforms various state-of-the-art methods and boosts the performance of deep-learned methods. MAC combined with deep-learned methods achieves state-of-the-art registration recall of 95.7% /78.9% on 3DMatch /3DLoMatch.

        **Abstract**:

        In panorama understanding, the widely used equirectangular projection (ERP) entails boundary discontinuity and spatial distortion. It severely deteriorates the conventional CNNs and vision Transformers on panoramas. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective architecture named PanoSwin to learn panorama representations with ERP. To deal with the challenges brought by equirectangular projection, we explore a pano-style shift windowing scheme and novel pitch attention to address the boundary discontinuity and the spatial distortion, respectively. Besides, based on spherical distance and Cartesian coordinates, we adapt absolute positional embeddings and relative positional biases for panoramas to enhance panoramic geometry information. Realizing that planar image understanding might share some common knowledge with panorama understanding, we devise a novel two-stage learning framework to facilitate knowledge transfer from the planar images to panoramas. We conduct experiments against the state-of-the-art on various panoramic tasks, i.e., panoramic object detection, panoramic classification, and panoramic layout estimation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PanoSwin in panorama understanding.

        **Abstract**:

        Feature matching is a challenging computer vision task that involves finding correspondences between two images of a 3D scene. In this paper we consider the dense approach instead of the more common sparse paradigm, thus striving to find all correspondences. Perhaps counter-intuitively, dense methods have previously shown inferior performance to their sparse and semi-sparse counterparts for estimation of two-view geometry. This changes with our novel dense method, which outperforms both dense and sparse methods on geometry estimation. The novelty is threefold: First, we propose a kernel regression global matcher. Secondly, we propose warp refinement through stacked feature maps and depthwise convolution kernels. Thirdly, we propose learning dense confidence through consistent depth and a balanced sampling approach for dense confidence maps. Through extensive experiments we confirm that our proposed dense method, Dense Kernelized Feature Matching, sets a new state-of-the-art on multiple geometry estimation benchmarks. In particular, we achieve an improvement on MegaDepth-1500 of +4.9 and +8.9 AUC@5¬∞ compared to the best previous sparse method and dense method respectively.

        **Abstract**:

        Local feature matching aims at establishing sparse correspondences between a pair of images. Recently, detector-free methods present generally better performance but are not satisfactory in image pairs with large scale differences. In this paper, we propose Patch Area Transportation with Subdivision (PATS) to tackle this issue. Instead of building an expensive image pyramid, we start by splitting the original image pair into equal-sized patches and gradually resizing and subdividing them into smaller patches with the same scale. However, estimating scale differences between these patches is non-trivial since the scale differences are determined by both relative camera poses and scene structures, and thus spatially varying over image pairs. Moreover, it is hard to obtain the ground truth for real scenes. To this end, we propose patch area transportation, which enables learning scale differences in a self-supervised manner. In contrast to bipartite graph matching, which only handles one-to-one matching, our patch area transportation can deal with many-to-many relationships. PATS improves both matching accuracy and coverage, and shows superior performance in downstream tasks, such as relative pose estimation, visual localization, and optical flow estimation.

        ## [1693] Correspondence Transformers with Asymmetric Feature Learning and Matching Flow Super-Resolution

        **Abstract**:

        This paper solves the problem of learning dense visual correspondences between different object instances of the same category with only sparse annotations. We decompose this pixel-level semantic matching problem into two easier ones: (i) First, local feature descriptors of source and target images need to be mapped into shared semantic spaces to get coarse matching flows. (ii) Second, matching flows in low resolution should be refined to generate accurate point-to-point matching results. We propose asymmetric feature learning and matching flow super-resolution based on vision transformers to solve the above problems. The asymmetric feature learning module exploits a biased cross-attention mechanism to encode token features of source images with their target counterparts. Then matching flow in low resolutions is enhanced by a super-resolution network to get accurate correspondences. Our pipeline is built upon vision transformers and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results on several popular benchmarks, such as PF-PASCAL, PF-WILLOW, and SPair-71 K, demonstrate that the proposed method can catch subtle semantic differences in pixels efficiently.

        **Abstract**:

        Recently, event-based stereo matching has been studied due to its robustness in poor light conditions. However, existing event-based stereo networks suffer severe performance degradation when domains shift. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims at resolving this problem without using the target domain ground-truth. However, traditional UDA still needs the input event data with ground- truth in the source domain, which is more challenging and costly to obtain than image data. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised domain Adaptive Dense Event Stereo (ADES), which resolves gaps between the different domains and input modalities. The proposed ADES framework adapts event-based stereo networks from abundant image datasets with ground-truth on the source domain to event datasets without ground-truth on the target domain, which is a more practical setup. First, we propose a self-supervision module that trains the network on the target domain through image reconstruction, while an artifact prediction network trained on the source domain assists in removing intermittent artifacts in the reconstructed image. Secondly, we utilize the feature-level normalization scheme to align the extracted features along the epipolar line. Finally, we present the motion-invariant consistency module to impose the consistent output between the perturbed motion. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves remarkable results in the adaptation ability of event-based stereo matching from the image domain.

        **Abstract**:

        Outlier-robust estimation involves estimating some parameters (e.g., 3D rotations) from data samples in the presence of outliers, and is typically formulated as a non-convex and non-smooth problem. For this problem, the classical method called iteratively reweighted least-squares (IRLS) and its variants have shown impressive performance. This paper makes several contributions towards understanding why these algorithms work so well. First, we incorporate majorization and graduated non-convexity (GNC) into the IRLS framework and prove that the resulting IRLS variant is a convergent method for outlier-robust estimation. Moreover, in the robust regression context with a constant fraction of outliers, we prove this IRLS variant converges to the ground truth at a global linear and local quadratic rate for a random Gaussian feature matrix with high probability. Experiments corroborate our theory and show that the proposed IRLS variant converges within 5‚Äì10 iterations for typical problem instances of outlier-robust estimation, while state-of-the-art methods need at least 30 iterations. A basic implementation of our method is provided: https://github.com/liangzu/IRLS-CVPR2023

        **Abstract**:

        In this paper, we propose YOSO, a real-time panoptic segmentation framework. YOSO predicts masks via dynamic convolutions between panoptic kernels and image feature maps, in which you only need to segment once for both instance and semantic segmentation tasks. To reduce the computational overhead, we design a feature pyramid aggregator for the feature map extraction, and a separable dynamic decoder for the panoptic kernel generation. The aggregator re-parameterizes interpolation-first modules in a convolution-first way, which significantly speeds up the pipeline without any additional costs. The decoder performs multi-head cross-attention via separable dynamic convolution for better efficiency and accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, YOSO is the first real-time panoptic segmentation framework that delivers competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Specifically, YOSO achieves 46.4 PQ, 45.6 FPS on COCO; 52.5 PQ, 22.6 FPS on Cityscapes; 38.0 PQ, 35.4 FPS on ADE20K; and 34.1 PQ, 7.1 FPS on Mapillary Vistas.

        **Abstract**:

        We present a novel bird's-eye-view (BEV) detector with perspective supervision, which converges faster and bet-suits modern image backbones. Existing state-of-the-art BEV detectors are often tied to certain depth pretrained backbones like Vo Vn et, hindering the synergy between booming image backbones and BEV detectors. To address this limitation, we prioritize easing the optimization of BEV detectors by introducing perspective view supervision. To this end, we propose a two-stage BEV detector; where proposals from the perspective head are fed into the bird‚Äô s-eye-view head for final predictions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive ablation studies focusing on the form of supervision and the gener-ality of the proposed detector. The proposed method is ver-ified with a wide spectrum of traditional and modern image backbones and achieves new SoTA results on the large-scale nuScenes dataset. The code shall be released soon.

        **Abstract**:

        Human-centric perceptions (e.g., pose estimation, human parsing, pedestrian detection, person re-identification, etc.) play a key role in industrial applications of visual models. While specific human-centric tasks have their own relevant semantic aspect to focus on, they also share the same underlying semantic structure of the human body. However, few works have attempted to exploit such homogeneity and design a general-propose model for human-centric tasks. In this work, we revisit a broad range of human-centric tasks and unify them in a minimalist manner. We propose UniHCP, a Unified Model for Human-Centric Perceptions, which unifies a wide range of human-centric tasks in a simplified end-to-end manner with the plain vision transformer architecture. With large-scale joint training on 33 human-centric datasets, UniHCP can outperform strong baselines on several in-domain and downstream tasks by direct evaluation. When adapted to a specific task, UniHCP achieves new SOTAs on a wide range of human-centric tasks, e.g., 69.8 mIoU on CIHP for human parsing, 86.18 mA on PA100K for attribute prediction, 90.3 mAP on Market1501 for ReID, and 85.8 JI on CrowdHuman for pedestrian detection, performing better than specialized models tailored for each task.

        **Abstract**:

        Modern autonomous driving system is characterized as modular tasks in sequential order, i.e., perception, prediction, and planning. In order to perform a wide diversity of tasks and achieve advanced-level intelligence, contemporary approaches either deploy standalone models for individual tasks, or design a multi-task paradigm with separate heads. However, they might suffer from accumulative errors or deficient task coordination. Instead, we argue that a favorable framework should be devised and optimized in pursuit of the ultimate goal, i.e., planning of the self-driving car. Oriented at this, we revisit the key components within perception and prediction, and prioritize the tasks such that all these tasks contribute to planning. We introduce Unified Autonomous Driving (UniAD), a comprehensive framework up-to-date that incorporates full-stack driving tasks in one network. It is exquisitely devised to leverage advantages of each module, and provide complementary feature abstractions for agent interaction from a global perspective. Tasks are communicated with unified query interfaces to facilitate each other toward planning. We instantiate UniAD on the challenging nuScenes benchmark. With extensive ablations, the effectiveness of using such a philosophy is proven by substantially outperforming previous state-of-the-arts in all aspects. Code and models are public.

        **Abstract**:

        Predicting the future trajectories of surrounding agents is essential for autonomous vehicles to operate safely. This paper presents QCNet, a modeling framework toward pushing the boundaries of trajectory prediction. First, we identify that the agent-centric modeling scheme used by existing approaches requires re-normalizing and re-encoding the input whenever the observation window slides forward, leading to redundant computations during online prediction. To overcome this limitation and achieve faster inference, we introduce a query-centric paradigm for scene encoding, which enables the reuse of past computations by learning representations independent of the global spacetime coordinate system. Sharing the invariant scene features among all target agents further allows the parallelism of multi-agent trajectory decoding. Second, even given rich encodings of the scene, existing decoding strategies struggle to capture the multimodality inherent in agents' future behavior, especially when the prediction horizon is long. To tackle this challenge, we first employ anchor-free queries to generate trajectory proposals in a recurrent fashion, which allows the model to utilize different scene contexts when decoding waypoints at different horizons. A refinement module then takes the trajectory proposals as anchors and leverages anchor-based queries to refine the trajectories further. By supplying adaptive and high-quality anchors to the refinement module, our query-based decoder can better deal with the multimodality in the output of trajectory prediction. Our approach ranks 1

 on Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 motion forecasting benchmarks, outperforming all methods on all main metrics by a large margin. Meanwhile, our model can achieve streaming scene encoding and parallel multi-agent decoding thanks to the query-centric design ethos.

        **Abstract**:

        The indeterminate nature of human motion requires trajectory prediction systems to use a probabilistic model to formulate the multi-modality phenomenon and infer a finite set of future trajectories. However, the inference processes of most existing methods rely on Monte Carlo random sampling, which is insufficient to cover the realistic paths with finite samples, due to the long tail effect of the predicted distribution. To promote the sampling process of stochastic prediction, we propose a novel method, called BOsampler, to adaptively mine potential paths with Bayesian optimization in an unsupervised manner, as a sequential design strategy in which new prediction is dependent on the previously drawn samples. Specifically, we model the trajectory sampling as a Gaussian process and construct an acquisition function to measure the potential sampling value. This acquisition function applies the original distribution as prior and encourages exploring paths in the long-tail region. This sampling method can be integrated with existing stochastic predictive models without retraining. Experimental results on various baseline methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The source code is released in this link.

        **Abstract**:

        Predicting future action locations is vital for applications like human-robot collaboration. While some computer vision tasks have made progress in predicting human actions, accurately localizing these actions in future frames remains an area with room for improvement. We introduce a new task called spatial action localization in the future (SALF), which aims to predict action locations in both observed and future frames. SALF is challenging because it requires understanding the underlying physics of video observations to predict future action locations accurately. To address SALF, we use the concept of NeuralODE, which models the latent dynamics of sequential data by solving ordinary differential equations (ODE) with neural networks. We propose a novel architecture, AdamsFormer, which extends observed frame features to future time horizons by modeling continuous temporal dynamics through ODE solving. Specifically, we employ the Adams method, a multi-step approach that efficiently uses information from previous steps without discarding it. Our extensive experiments on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing long-range temporal modeling methods by a significant margin in terms of frame-mAP.

        **Abstract**:

        We study ObjectGoal Navigation - where a virtual robot situated in a new environment is asked to navigate to an object. Prior work [1] has shown that imitation learning (IL) using behavior cloning (BC) on a dataset of human demonstrations achieves promising results. However, this has limitations - 1) BC policies generalize poorly to new states, since the training mimics actions not their consequences, and 2) collecting demonstrations is expensive. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) is trivially scalable, but requires careful reward engineering to achieve desirable behavior. We present PIRLNav, a two-stage learning scheme for BC pretraining on human demonstrations followed by RL-finetuning. This leads to a policy that achieves a success rate of 65.0% on OBJECTNAV (+5.0% absolute over previous state-of-the-art). Using this BC‚ÜíRL training recipe, we present a rigorous empirical analysis of design choices. First, we investigate whether human demonstrations can be replaced with ‚Äòfree‚Äô (automatically generated) sources of demonstrations, e.g. shortest paths (SP) or task-agnostic frontier exploration (FE) trajectories. We find that BC‚ÜíRL on human demonstrations outperforms BC‚ÜíRL on SP and FE trajectories, even when controlled for the same BC-pretraining success on TRAIN, and even on a subset of VAL episodes where BC-pretraining success favors the SP or FE policies. Next, we study how RL-finetuning performance scales with the size of the BC pretraining dataset. We find that as we increase the size of the BC-pretraining dataset and get to high BC accuracies, the improvements from RL-finetuning are smaller, and that 90% of the performance of our best BC‚ÜíRL policy can be achieved with less than half the number of BC demonstrations. Finally, we analyze failure modes of our OBJECTNAV policies, and present guidelines for further improving them. Project page: ram81.github.io/projects/pirlnav.

        Expert demonstrations are a rich source of supervision for training visual robotic manipulation policies, but imitation learning methods often require either a large number of demonstrations or expensive online expert supervision to learn reactive closed-loop behaviors. In this work, we introduce SPARTN (Synthetic Perturbations for Augmenting Robot Trajectories via NeRF): a fully-offline data augmentation scheme for improving robot policies that use eye-in-hand cameras. Our approach leverages neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to synthetically inject corrective noise into visual demonstrations, using NeRFs to generate perturbed viewpoints while simultaneously calculating the corrective actions. This requires no additional expert supervision or environment interaction, and distills the geometric information in NeRFs into a real-time reactive RGB-only policy. In a simulated 6-DoF visual grasping benchmark, SPARTN improves success rates by 2.8√ó over imitation learning without the corrective augmentations and even outperforms some methods that use online supervision. It additionally closes the gap between RGB-only and RGB-D success rates, eliminating the previous need for depth sensors. In real-world 6-DoF robotic grasping experiments from limited human demonstrations, our method improves absolute success rates by 22.5% on average, including objects that are traditionally challenging for depth-based methods.

        **Abstract**:

        Camouflaged Instance Segmentation (CIS) aims at predicting the instance-level masks of camouflaged objects, which are usually the animals in the wild adapting their appearance to match the surroundings. Previous instance segmentation methods perform poorly on this task as they are easily disturbed by the deceptive camouflage. To address these challenges, we propose a novel De-camouflaging Network (DCNet) including a pixel-level camouflage decoupling module and an instance-level camouflage suppression module. The proposed DCNet enjoys several merits. First, the pixel-level camouflage decoupling module can extract camouflage characteristics based on the Fourier transformation. Then a difference attention mechanism is proposed to eliminate the camouflage characteristics while reserving target object characteristics in the pixel feature. Second, the instance-level camouflage suppression module can aggregate rich instance information from pixels by use of instance prototypes. To mitigate the effect of background noise during segmentation, we introduce some reliable reference points to build a more robust similarity measurement. With the aid of these two modules, our DCNet can effectively model de-camouflaging and achieve accurate segmentation for camouflaged instances. Extensive experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate that our DCNet performs favorably against state-of-the-art CIS methods, e.g., with more than 5% performance gains on COD10K and NC4K datasets in average precision.

        **Abstract**:

        This work proposes an end-to-end multi-camera 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) framework. It emphasizes spatio-temporal continuity and integrates both past and future reasoning for tracked objects. Thus, we name it ‚ÄúPast- and-Future reasoning for Tracking‚Äù (PF-Track). Specifically, our method adopts the ‚Äútracking by attention‚Äù framework and represents tracked instances coherently over time with object queries. To explicitly use historical cues, our ‚ÄúPast Reasoning‚Äù module learns to refine the tracks and enhance the object features by cross-attending to queries from previous frames and other objects. The ‚ÄúFuture Reasoning‚Äù module digests historical information and predicts robust future trajectories. In the case of long-term occlusions, our method maintains the object positions and enables re-association by integrating motion predictions. On the nuScenes dataset, our method improves AMOTA by a large margin and remarkably reduces ID-Switches by 90% compared to prior approaches, which is an order of magnitude less. The code and models are made available at https://github.com/TRI-ML/PF-Track.

        **Abstract**:

        The main challenge of Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) lies in maintaining a continuous trajectory for each target. Existing methods often learn reliable motion patterns to match the same target between adjacent frames and discriminative appearance features to re-identify the lost targets after a long period. However, the reliability of motion prediction and the discriminability of appearances can be easily hurt by dense crowds and extreme occlusions in the tracking process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective multi-object tracker, i.e., MotionTrack, which learns robust short-term and long-term motions in a unified framework to associate trajectories from a short to long range. For dense crowds, we design a novel Interaction Module to learn interaction-aware motions from short-term trajectories, which can estimate the complex movement of each target. For extreme occlusions, we build a novel Refind Module to learn reliable long-term motions from the target's history trajectory, which can link the interrupted trajectory with its corresponding detection. Our Interaction Module and Refind Module are embedded in the well-known tracking-by-detection paradigm, which can work in tandem to maintain superior performance. Extensive experimental results on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in challenging scenarios, and it achieves state-of-the-art performances at various MOT metrics.

        **Authors**: *Yufeng Cui, Yimei Kang*

        **Abstract**:

        Gait recognition is a biometric technology that identifies people by their walking patterns. The silhouettes-based method and the skeletons-based method are the two most popular approaches. However, the silhouette data are easily affected by clothing occlusion, and the skeleton data lack body shape information. To obtain a more robust and comprehensive gait representation for recognition, we propose a transformer-based gait recognition framework called MMGaitFormer, which effectively fuses and aggregates the spatial-temporal information from the skeletons and silhouettes. Specifically, a Spatial Fusion M odule (SFM) and a Temporal Fusion Module (TFM) are proposed for effective spatial-level and temporal-level feature fusion, respectively. The SFM performs fine-grained body parts spatial fusion and guides the alignment of each part of the silhouette and each joint of the skeleton through the attention mechanism. The TFM performs temporal modeling through Cycle Position Embedding (CPE) andfuses temporal information of two modalities. Experiments demonstrate that our MMGaitFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular gait datasets. For the most challenging ‚ÄúCL‚Äù (i.e., walking in different clothes) condition in CASIA-B, our method achieves a rank-l accuracy of 94. 8%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art single-modal methods by a large margin.

        **Abstract**:

        Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) is a rapidly developing field that focuses on recognizing facial expressions in video format. Previous research has considered non-target frames as noisy frames, but we propose that it should be treated as a weakly supervised problem. We also identify the imbalance of short- and long-term temporal relationships in DFER. Therefore, we introduce the Multi-3D Dynamic Facial Expression Learning (M3DFEL) framework, which utilizes Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) to handle inexact labels. M3DFEL generates 3D-instances to model the strong short-term temporal relationship and utilizes 3DCNNs for feature extraction. The Dynamic Long-term Instance Aggregation Module (DLIAM) is then utilized to learn the long-term temporal relationships and dynamically aggregate the instances. Our experiments on DFEW and FERV39K datasets show that M3DFEL outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with a vanilla R3D18 backbone.

        **Abstract**:

        Talking head generation aims to generate faces that maintain the identity information of the source image and imitate the motion of the driving image. Most pioneering methods rely primarily on 2D representations and thus will inevitably suffer from face distortion when large head rotations are encountered. Recent works instead employ explicit 3D structural representations or implicit neural rendering to improve performance under large pose changes. Nevertheless, the fidelity of identity and expression is not so desirable, especially for novel-view synthesis. In this paper, we propose HiDe-NeRF, which achieves high-fidelity and free-view talking-head synthesis. Drawing on the recently proposed Deformable Neural Radiance Fields, HiDe-NeRF represents the 3D dynamic scene into a canonical appearance field and an implicit deformation field, where the former comprises the canonical source face and the latter models the driving pose and expression. In particular, we improve fidelity from two aspects: (i) to enhance identity expressiveness, we design a generalized appearance module that leverages multi-scale volume features to preserve face shape and details; (ii) to improve expression preciseness, we propose a lightweight deformation module that explicitly decouples the pose and expression to enable precise expression modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach can generate better results than previous works. Project page: https://www.waytron.net/hidenerf/

        **Abstract**:

        We present a novel one-shot talking head synthesis method that achieves disentangled and fine-grained control over lip motion, eye gaze&blink, head pose, and emotional expression. We represent different motions via disentangled latent representations and leverage an image generator to synthesize talking heads from them. To effectively disentangle each motion factor, we propose a progressive disentangled representation learning strategy by separating the factors in a coarse-to-fine manner, where we first extract unified motion feature from the driving signal, and then isolate each fine-grained motion from the unified feature. We leverage motion-specific contrastive learning and regressing for non-emotional motions, and introduce feature-level decorrelation and self-reconstruction for emotional expression, to fully utilize the inherent properties of each motion factor in unstructured video data to achieve disentanglement. Experiments show that our method provides high quality speech&lip-motion synchronization along with precise and disentangled control over multiple extra facial motions, which can hardly be achieved by previous methods.

        **Abstract**:

        Video-based person reidentification (Re-ID) is a prominent computer vision topic due to its wide range of video surveillance applications. Most existing methods utilize spatial and temporal correlations in frame sequences to obtain discriminative person features. However, inevitable degradation, e.g., motion blur contained in frames, leading to the loss of identity-discriminating cues. Recently, a new bio-inspired sensor called event camera, which can asynchronously record intensity changes, brings new vitality to the Re-ID task. With the microsecond resolution and low latency, it can accurately capture the movements of pedestrians even in the degraded environments. In this work, we propose a Sparse-Dense Complementary Learning (SDCL) Framework, which effectively extracts identity features by fully exploiting the complementary information of dense frames and sparse events. Specifically, for frames, we build a CNN-based module to aggregate the dense features of pedestrian appearance step by step, while for event streams, we design a bio-inspired spiking neural network (SNN) backbone, which encodes event signals into sparse feature maps in a spiking form, to extract the dynamic motion cues of pedestrians. Finally, a cross feature alignment module is constructed to fuse motion information from events and appearance cues from frames to enhance identity representation learning. Experiments on several benchmarks show that by employing events and SNN into Re-ID, our method significantly outperforms competitive methods.

        **Abstract**:

        We study a challenging task, conditional human motion generation, which produces plausible human motion sequences according to various conditional inputs, such as action classes or textual descriptors. Since human motions are highly diverse and have a property of quite different distribution from conditional modalities, such as textual descriptors in natural languages, it is hard to learn a probabilistic mapping from the desired conditional modality to the human motion sequences. Besides, the raw motion data from the motion capture system might be redundant in sequences and contain noises; directly modeling the joint distribution over the raw motion sequences and conditional modalities would need a heavy computational over-head and might result in artifacts introduced by the captured noises. To learn a better representation of the various human motion sequences, we first design a powerful Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) and arrive at a representative and low-dimensional latent code for a human motion sequence. Then, instead of using a diffusion model to establish the connections between the raw motion sequences and the conditional inputs, we perform a diffusion process on the motion latent space. Our proposed Motion Latent-based Diffusion model (MLD) could produce vivid motion sequences conforming to the given conditional inputs and substantially reduce the computational overhead in both the training and inference stages. Extensive experiments on various human motion generation tasks demonstrate that our MLD achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods among extensive human motion generation tasks, with two orders of magnitude faster than previous diffusion models on raw motion sequences.

        **Abstract**:

        Current state-of-the-art approaches for few-shot action recognition achieve promising performance by conducting frame-level matching on learned visual features. However, they generally suffer from two limitations: i) the matching procedure between local frames tends to be inaccurate due to the lack of guidance to force long-range temporal perception; ii) explicit motion learning is usually ignored, leading to partial information loss. To address these issues, we develop a Motion-augmented Long-short Contrastive Learning (MoLo) method that contains two crucial components, including a long-short contrastive objective and a motion autodecoder. Specifically, the long-short contrastive objective is to endow local frame features with long-form temporal awareness by maximizing their agreement with the global token of videos belonging to the same class. The motion autodecoder is a lightweight architecture to reconstruct pixel motions from the differential features, which explicitly embeds the network with motion dynamics. By this means, MoLo can simultaneously learn long-range temporal context and motion cues for comprehensive few-shot matching. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate MoLo on five standard benchmarks, and the results show that MoLo favorably outperforms recent advanced methods.

        **Abstract**:

        Most of the artificial lights fluctuate in response to the grid's alternating current and exhibit subtle variations in terms of both intensity and spectrum, providing the potential to estimate the Electric Network Frequency (ENF)from conventional frame-based videos. Nevertheless, the performance of Video-based ENF (V-ENF) estimation largely re-lies on the imaging quality and thus may suffer from significant interference caused by non-ideal sampling, motion, and extreme lighting conditions. In this paper, we show that the ENF can be extracted without the above limitations from a new modality provided by the so-called event camera, a neuromorphic sensor that encodes the light intensity variations and asynchronously emits events with extremely high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Specifically, we first formulate and validate the physical mechanism for the ENF captured in events, and then propose a simple yet robust Event-based ENF (E-ENF) estimation method through mode filtering and harmonic enhancement. Furthermore, we build an Event-Video ENF Dataset (EV-ENFD) that records both events and videos in diverse scenes. Extensive experiments on EV-ENFD demonstrate that our proposed E-ENF method can extract more accurate ENF traces, outperforming the conventional V-ENF by a large margin, especially in challenging environments with object motions and extreme lighting conditions.

        **Abstract**:

        Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) aims to generate intermediate video frames between consecutive input frames. Since the event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that only encode brightness changes with a micro-second temporal resolution, several works utilized the event camera to enhance the performance of VFI. However, existing methods estimate bidirectional inter-frame motion fields with only events or approximations, which can not consider the complex motion in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel event-based VFI framework with crossmodal asymmetric bidirectional motion field estimation. In detail, our EIF-BiOFNet utilizes each valuable characteristic of the events and images for direct estimation of inter-frame motion fields without any approximation methods. Moreover, we develop an interactive attention-based frame synthesis network to efficiently leverage the complementary warping-based and synthesis-based features. Finally, we build a large-scale event-based VFI dataset, ERF-X170FPS, with a high frame rate, extreme motion, and dynamic textures to overcome the limitations of previous event-based VFI datasets. Extensive experimental results validate that our method shows significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art VFI methods on various datasets.

        **Abstract**:

        The performance of video frame interpolation is inherently correlated with the ability to handle motion in the input scene. Even though previous works recognize the utility of asynchronous event information for this task, they ignore the fact that motion may or may not result in blur in the input video to be interpolated, depending on the length of the exposure time of the frames and the speed of the motion, and assume either that the input video is sharp, restricting themselves to frame interpolation, or that it is blurry, including an explicit, separate deblurring stage before interpolation in their pipeline. We instead propose a general method for event-based frame interpolation that performs deblurring ad-hoc and thus works both on sharp and blurry input videos. Our model consists in a bidirectional recurrent network that naturally incorporates the temporal dimension of interpolation and fuses information from the input frames and the events adaptively based on their temporal proximity. In addition, we introduce a novel real-world high-resolution dataset with events and color videos named HighREV, which provides a challenging evaluation setting for the examined task. Extensive experiments on the standard CoPro benchmark and on our dataset show that our network consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on frame interpolation, single image deblurring and the joint task of interpolation and deblurring.

        Video dehazing aims to recover haze-free frames with high visibility and contrast. This paper presents a novel framework to effectively explore the physical haze priors and aggregate temporal information. Specifically, we design a memory-based physical prior guidance module to encode the prior-related features into long-range memory. Besides, we formulate a multi-range scene radiance recovery module to capture space-time dependencies in multiple space-time ranges, which helps to effectively aggregate temporal information from adjacent frames. Moreover, we construct the first large-scale outdoor video dehazing benchmark dataset, which contains videos in various real-world scenarios. Experimental results on both synthetic and real conditions show the superiority of our proposed method.

        **Abstract**:

        Optical flow is an indispensable building block for various important computer vision tasks, including motion estimation, object tracking, and disparity measurement. In this work, we propose TransFlow, a pure transformer architecture for optical flow estimation. Compared to dominant CNN-based methods, TransFlow demonstrates three advantages. First, it provides more accurate correlation and trustworthy matching in flow estimation by utilizing spatial self-attention and crossattention mechanisms between adjacent frames to effectively capture global dependencies; Second, it recovers more compromised information (e.g., occlusion and motion blur) in flow estimation through long-range temporal association in dynamic scenes; Third, it enables a concise self-learning paradigm and effectively eliminate the complex and laborious multi-stage pre-training procedures. We achieve the state-of-the-art results on the Sintel, KITTI-15, as well as several downstream tasks, including video object detection, interpolation and stabilization. For its efficacy, we hope TransFlow could serve as a flexible baseline for optical flow estimation.

        **Abstract**:

        We present a mask-piloted Transformer which improves masked-attention in Mask2Former for image segmentation. The improvement is based on our observation that Mask2Former suffers from inconsistent mask predictions between consecutive decoder layers, which leads to inconsistent optimization goals and low utilization of decoder queries. To address this problem, we propose a mask-piloted training approach, which additionally feeds noised ground-truth masks in masked-attention and trains the model to reconstruct the original ones. Compared with the predicted masks used in mask-attention, the ground-truth masks serve as a pilot and effectively alleviate the negative impact of inaccurate mask predictions in Mask2Former. Based on this technique, our MP-Former achieves a remarkable performance improvement on all three image segmentation tasks (instance, panoptic, and semantic), yielding +2.3AP and +1.6mIoU on the Cityscapes instance and semantic segmentation tasks with a ResNet-50 backbone. Our method also significantly speeds up the training, outperforming Mask2Former with half of the number of training epochs on ADE20K with both a ResNet-50 and a Swin-L backbones. Moreover, our method only introduces little computation during training and no extra computation during inference. Our code will be released at https://github.com/IDEA-Research/MP-Former.

        **Abstract**:

        We present an approach to learning regular spatial transformations between image pairs in the context of medical image registration. Contrary to optimization-based registration techniques and many modern learning-based methods, we do not directly penalize transformation irregularities but instead promote transformation regularity via an inverse consistency penalty. We use a neural network to predict a map between a source and a target image as well as the map when swapping the source and target images. Different from existing approaches, we compose these two resulting maps and regularize deviations of the Jacobian of this composition from the identity matrix. This regularizer - GradICON - results in much better convergence when training registration models compared to promoting inverse consistency of the composition of maps directly while retaining the desirable implicit regularization effects of the latter. We achieve state-of-the-art registration performance on a variety of real-world medical image datasets using a single set of hyperparameters and a single non-dataset-specific training protocol.

        ## [1722] Neural Texture Synthesis with Guided Correspondence

        **Authors**: *Yang Zhou, Kaijian Chen, Rongjun Xiao, Hui Huang*

        **Abstract**:

        Markov random fields (MRFs) are the cornerstone of classical approaches to example-based texture synthesis. Yet, it is not fully valued in the deep learning era. This pa-per aims to re-promote the combination of MRFs and neural networks, i.e., the CNNMRF model, for texture synthesis, with two key observations made. We first propose to compute the Guided Correspondence Distance in the nearest neighbor search, based on which a Guided Correspondence loss is defined to measure the similarity of the output texture to the example. Experiments show that our approach sur-passes existing neural approaches in uncontrolled and con-trolled texture synthesis. More importantly, the Guided Cor-respondence loss can function as a general textural loss in, e.g., training generative networks for real-time controlled synthesis and inversion-based single-image editing. In con-trast, existing textural losses, such as the Sliced Wasserstein loss, cannot work on these challenging tasks.

        ## [1723] Self-supervised Non-uniform Kernel Estimation with Flow-based Motion Prior for Blind Image Deblurring

        **Authors**: *Zhenxuan Fang, Fangfang Wu, Weisheng Dong, Xin Li, Jinjian Wu, Guangming Shi*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **Abstract**:

        Many deep learning-based solutions to blind image deblurring estimate the blur representation and reconstruct the target image from its blurry observation. However, these methods suffer from severe performance degradation in real-world scenarios because they ignore important prior information about motion blur (e.g., real-world motion blur is diverse and spatially varying). Some methods have attempted to explicitly estimate non-uniform blur kernels by CNNs, but accurate estimation is still challenging due to the lack of ground truth about spatially varying blur kernels in real-world images. To address these issues, we propose to represent the field of motion blur kernels in a latent space by normalizing flows, and design CNNs to predict the latent codes instead of motion kernels. To further improve the accuracy and robustness of non-uniform kernel estimation, we introduce uncertainty learning into the process of estimating latent codes and propose a multi-scale kernel attention module to better integrate image features with estimated kernels. Extensive experimental results, especially on real-world blur datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of both subjective and objective quality as well as excellent generalization performance for non-uniform image deblurring.

        ## [1724] Decoupling-and-Aggregating for Image Exposure Correction

        **Authors**: *Yang Wang, Long Peng, Liang Li, Yang Cao, Zheng-Jun Zha*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01737](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01737)

        **Abstract**:

        The images captured under improper exposure conditions often suffer from contrast degradation and detail distortion. Contrast degradation will destroy the statistical properties of low-frequency components, while detail distortion will disturb the structural properties of high-frequency components, leading to the low-frequency and high-frequency components being mixed and inseparable. This will limit the statistical and structural modeling capacity for exposure correction. To address this issue, this paper proposes to decouple the contrast enhancement and detail restoration within each convolution process. It is based on the observation that, in the local regions covered by convolution kernels, the feature response of low-/high-frequency can be decoupled by addition/difference operation. To this end, we inject the addition/difference operation into the convolution process and devise a Contrast Aware (CA) unit and a Detail Aware (DA) unit to facilitate the statistical and structural regularities modeling. The proposed CA and DA can be plugged into existing CNN-based exposure correction networks to substitute the Traditional Convolution (TConv) to improve the performance. Furthermore, to maintain the computational costs of the network without changing, we aggregate two units into a single TConv kernel using structural re-parameterization. Evaluations of nine methods and five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can comprehensively improve the performance of existing methods without introducing extra computational costs compared with the original networks. The codes will be publicly available.

        ## [1725] You Do Not Need Additional Priors or Regularizers in Retinex-Based Low-Light Image Enhancement

        **Authors**: *Huiyuan Fu, Wenkai Zheng, Xiangyu Meng, Xin Wang, Chuanming Wang, Huadong Ma*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01738](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01738)

        **Abstract**:

        Images captured in low-light conditions often suffer from significant quality degradation. Recent works have built a large variety of deep Retinex-based networks to enhance low-light images. The Retinex-based methods require decomposing the image into reflectance and illumination components, which is a highly ill-posed problem and there is no available ground truth. Previous works addressed this problem by imposing some additional priors or regularizers. However, finding an effective prior or regularizer that can be applied in various scenes is challenging, and the performance of the model suffers from too many additional constraints. We propose a contrastive learning method and a self-knowledge distillation method for Retinex decomposition that allow training our Retinex-based model without elaborate hand-crafted regularization functions. Rather than estimating reflectance and illuminance images and representing the final images as their element-wise products as in previous works, our regularizer-free Retinex decomposition and synthesis network (RFR) extracts reflectance and illuminance features and synthesizes them end-to-end. In addition, we propose a loss function for contrastive learning and a progressive learning strategy for self-knowledge distillation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods can achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

        **Abstract**:

        The exclusive properties of RAW data have shown great potential for low-light image enhancement. Nevertheless, the performance is bottlenecked by the inherent limitations of existing architectures in both single-stage and multi-stage methods. Mixed mapping across two different domains, noise-to-clean and RAW-to-sRGB, misleads the single-stage methods due to the domain ambiguity. The multi-stage methods propagate the information merely through the resulting image of each stage, neglecting the abundant features in the lossy image-level dataflow. In this paper, we probe a generalized solution to these bottlenecks and propose a Decouple aNd Feedback framework, abbreviated as DNF. To mitigate the domain ambiguity, domain-specific subtasks are decoupled, along with fully utilizing the unique properties in RAW and sRGB domains. The feature propagation across stages with a feedback mechanism avoids the information loss caused by image-level dataflow. The two key insights of our method resolve the inherent limitations of RAW data-based low-light image enhancement satisfactorily, empowering our method to outperform the previous state-of-the-art method by a large margin with only 19% parameters, achieving 0.97dB and 1.30dB PSNR improvements on the Sony and Fuji subsets of SID.

        ## [1727] Contrastive Semi-Supervised Learning for Underwater Image Restoration via Reliable Bank

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01740](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01740)

        **Abstract**:

        Despite the remarkable achievement of recent underwater image restoration techniques, the lack of labeled data has become a major hurdle for further progress. In this work, we propose a mean-teacher based Semi-supervised Underwater Image Restoration (Semi-UIR) framework to incorporate the unlabeled data into network training. However, the naive mean-teacher method suffers from two main problems: (1) The consistency loss used in training might become ineffective when the teacher's prediction is wrong. (2) Using L1 distance may cause the network to overfit wrong labels, resulting in confirmation bias. To address the above problems, we first introduce a reliable bank to store the ‚Äúbest-ever‚Äù outputs as pseudo ground truth. To assess the quality of outputs, we conduct an empirical analysis based on the monotonicity property to select the most trustworthy NR-IQA method. Besides, in view of the confirmation bias problem, we incorporate contrastive regularization to prevent the overfitting on wrong labels. Experimental results on both full-reference and non-reference underwater benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm has obvious improvement over SOTA methods quantitatively and qualitatively. Code has been released at https://github.com/Huang-ShiRui/Semi-UIR.

        **Abstract**:

        Despite the significant results on synthetic noise under simplified assumptions, most self-supervised denoising methods fail under real noise due to the strong spatial noise correlation, including the advanced self-supervised blindspot networks (BSNs). For recent methods targeting real-world denoising, they either suffer from ignoring this spatial correlation, or are limited by the destruction of fine textures for under-considering the correlation. In this paper, we present a novel method called LG-BPN for self-supervised real-world denoising, which takes the spatial correlation statistic into our network design for local detail restoration, and also brings the long-range dependencies modeling ability to previously CNN-based BSN methods. First, based on the correlation statistic, we propose a densely-sampled patch-masked convolution module. By taking more neighbor pixels with low noise correlation into account, we enable a denser local receptive field, preserving more useful information for enhanced fine structure recovery. Second, we propose a dilated Transformer block to allow distant context exploitation in BSN. This global perception addresses the intrinsic deficiency of BSN, whose receptive field is constrained by the blind spot requirement, which can not be fully resolved by the previous CNN-based BSNs. These two designs enable LG-BPN to fully exploit both the detailed structure and the global interaction in a blind manner. Extensive results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method. https://github.com/Wang-XIaoDingdd/LGBPN

        ## [1729] Spectral Bayesian Uncertainty for Image Super-Resolution

        **Authors**: *Tao Liu, Jun Cheng, Shan Tan*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01742](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01742)

        **Abstract**:

        Recently deep learning techniques have significantly advanced image super-resolution (SR). Due to the black-box nature, quantifying reconstruction uncertainty is crucial when employing these deep SR networks. Previous approaches for SR uncertainty estimation mostly focus on capturing pixel-wise uncertainty in the spatial domain. SR uncertainty in the frequency domain which is highly related to image SR is seldom explored. In this paper, we propose to quantify spectral Bayesian uncertainty in image SR. To achieve this, a Dual-Domain Learning (DDL) framework is first proposed. Combined with Bayesian approaches, the DDL model is able to estimate spectral uncertainty accurately, enabling a reliability assessment for high frequencies reasoning from the frequency domain perspective. Extensive experiments under non-ideal premises are conducted and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spectral uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose a novel Spectral Uncertainty based Decoupled Frequency (SUDF) training scheme for perceptual SR. Experimental results show the proposed SUDF can evidently boost perceptual quality of SR results without sacrificing much pixel accuracy.

        **Abstract**:

        Deep image prior (DIP) has shown great promise in tackling a variety of image restoration (IR) and general visual inverse problems, needing no training data. However, the resulting optimization process is often very slow, inevitably hindering DIP's practical usage for time-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we focus on IR, and propose two crucial modifications to DIP that help achieve substantial speedup: 1) optimizing the DIP seed while freezing randomly-initialized network weights, and 2) reducing the network depth. In addition, we reintroduce explicit priors, such as sparse gradient prior-encoded by total-variation regularization, to preserve the DIP peak performance. We evaluate the proposed method on three IR tasks, including image denoising, image super-resolution, and image inpainting, against the original DIP and variants, as well as the competing metaDIP that uses meta-learning to learn good initializers with extra data. Our method is a clear winner in obtaining competitive restoration quality in a minimal amount of time. Our code is available at https://github.com/sun-umn/Deep-Random-Projector.

        ## [1731] Context-Aware Pretraining for Efficient Blind Image Decomposition

        **Authors**: *Chao Wang, Zhedong Zheng, Ruijie Quan, Yifan Sun, Yi Yang*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01744](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01744)

        **Abstract**:

        In this paper, we study Blind Image Decomposition (BID), which is to uniformly remove multiple types of degradation at once without foreknowing the noise type. There remain two practical challenges: (1) Existing methods typically require massive data supervision, making them infeasible to real-world scenarios. (2) The conventional paradigm usually focuses on mining the abnormal pattern of a superimposed image to separate the noise, which de facto conflicts with the primary image restoration task. Therefore, such a pipeline compromises repairing efficiency and authenticity. In an attempt to solve the two challenges in one go, we propose an efficient and simplified paradigm, called Context-aware Pretraining (CP), with two pretext tasks: mixed image separation and masked image reconstruction. Such a paradigm reduces the annotation demands and explicitly facilitates context-aware feature learning. Assuming the restoration process follows a structure-to-texture manner, we also introduce a Context-aware Pretrained network (CPNet). In particular, CPNet contains two transformer-based parallel encoders, one information fusion module, and one multi-head prediction module. The information fusion module explicitly utilizes the mutual correlation in the spatial-channel dimension, while the multi-head prediction module facilitates texture-guided appearance flow. Moreover, a new sampling loss along with an attribute label constraint is also deployed to make use of the spatial context, leading to high-fidelity image restoration. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic benchmarks show that our method achieves competitive performance for various BID tasks.

        ## [1732] Metadata-Based RAW Reconstruction via Implicit Neural Functions

        **Authors**: *Leyi Li, Huijie Qiao, Qi Ye, Qinmin Yang*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01745](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01745)

        **Abstract**:

        Many low-level computer vision tasks are desirable to utilize the unprocessed RAW image as input, which remains the linear relationship between pixel values and scene radiance. Recent works advocate to embed the RAW image samples into sRGB images at capture time, and reconstruct the RAW from sRGB by these metadata when needed. However, there still exist some limitations in making full use of the metadata. In this paper, instead of following the perspective of sRGB-to-RAW mapping, we reformulate the problem as mapping the 2D coordinates of the metadata to its RAW values conditioned on the corresponding sRGB values. With this novel formulation, we propose to reconstruct the RAW image with an implicit neural function, which achieves significant performance improvement (more than 10dB average PSNR) only with the uniform sampling. Compared with most deep learning-based approaches, our method is trained in a self-supervised way that requiring no pre-training on different camera ISPs. We perform further experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and show that our framework is also suitable for the task of guided super-resolution.

        **Abstract**:

        While raw images exhibit advantages over sRGB images (e.g., linearity and fine-grained quantization level), they are not widely used by common users due to the large storage requirements. Very recent works propose to compress raw images by designing the sampling masks in the raw image pixel space, leading to suboptimal image representations and redundant metadata. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn a compact representation in the latent space serving as the metadata in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we propose a novel sRGB-guided context model with the improved entropy estimation strategies, which leads to better reconstruction quality, smaller size of metadata, and faster speed. We illustrate how the proposed raw image compression scheme can adaptively allocate more bits to image regions that are important from a global perspective. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve superior raw image reconstruction results using a smaller size of the metadata on both uncompressed sRGB images and JPEG images.

        **Abstract**:

        Recently, deep neural networks have been successfully applied for image restoration (IR) (e.g., super-resolution, de-noising, de-blurring). Despite their promising performance, running IR networks requires heavy computation. A large body of work has been devoted to addressing this issue by designing novel neural networks or pruning their parameters. However, the common limitation is that while images are saved in a compressed format before being enhanced by IR, prior work does not consider the impact of compression on the IR quality. In this paper, we present AccelIR, a framework that optimizes image compression considering the end-to-end pipeline of IR tasks. AccelIR encodes an image through IR-aware compression that optimizes compression levels across image blocks within an image according to the impact on the IR quality. Then, it runs a lightweight IR network on the compressed image, effectively reducing IR computation, while maintaining the same IR quality and image size. Our extensive evaluation using nine IR networks shows that AccelIR can reduce the computing overhead of super-resolution, de-nosing, and de-blurring by 49%, 29%, and 32% on average, respectively.

        **Abstract**:

        Real world images often have highly imbalanced content density. Some areas are very uniform, e.g., large patches of blue sky, while other areas are scattered with many small objects. Yet, the commonly used successive grid downsampling strategy in convolutional deep networks treats all areas equally. Hence, small objects are represented in very few spatial locations, leading to worse results in tasks such as segmentation. Intuitively, retaining more pixels representing small objects during downsampling helps to preserve important information. To achieve this, we propose AutoFocusFormer (AFF), a local-attention transformer image recognition backbone, which performs adaptive down-sampling by learning to retain the most important pixels for the task. Since adaptive downsampling generates a set of pixels irregularly distributed on the image plane, we abandon the classic grid structure. Instead, we develop a novel point-based local attention block, facilitated by a balanced clustering module and a learnable neighborhood merging module, which yields representations for our point-based versions of state-of-the-art segmentation heads. Experiments show that our AutoFocusFormer (AFF) improves significantly over baseline models of similar sizes.

        **Abstract**:

        Performing super-resolution of a depth image using the guidance from an RGB image is a problem that concerns several fields, such as robotics, medical imaging, and remote sensing. While deep learning methods have achieved good results in this problem, recent work highlighted the value of combining modern methods with more formal frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel approach which combines guided anisotropic diffusion with a deep convolutional network and advances the state of the art for guided depth super-resolution. The edge transferring/enhancing properties of the diffusion are boosted by the contextual reasoning capabilities of modern networks, and a strict adjustment step guarantees perfect adherence to the source image. We achieve unprecedented results in three commonly used benchmarks for guided depth superresolution. The performance gain compared to other methods is the largest at larger scales, such as √ó 32 scaling. Code

        **Abstract**:

        We propose Super-resolution Neural Operator (SRNO), a deep operator learning framework that can resolve high-resolution (HR) images at arbitrary scales from the low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Treating the LR-HR image pairs as continuous functions approximated with different grid sizes, SRNO learns the mapping between the corresponding function spaces. From the perspective of approximation theory, SRNO first embeds the LR input into a higher-dimensional latent representation space, trying to capture sufficient basis functions, and then iteratively approximates the implicit image function with a kernel integral mechanism, followed by a final dimensionality reduction step to generate the RGB representation at the target coordinates. The key characteristics distinguishing SRNO from prior continuous SR works are: 1) the kernel integral in each layer is efficiently implemented via the Galerkin-type attention, which possesses non-local properties in the spatial domain and therefore benefits the grid-free continuum; and 2) the multilayer attention architecture allows for the dynamic latent basis update, which is crucial for SR problems to ‚Äúhallucinate‚Äù high-frequency information from the LR image. Experiments show that SRNO outperforms existing continuous SR methods in terms of both accuracy and running time. Our code is at https://github.com/2y7c3/Super-Resolution-Neural-Operator.

        **Abstract**:

        Implicit neural representation has recently shown a promising ability in representing images with arbitrary resolutions. In this paper, we present a Local Implicit Transformer (LIT), which integrates the attention mechanism and frequency encoding technique into a local implicit image function. We design a cross-scale local attention block to effectively aggregate local features and a local frequency encoding block to combine positional encoding with Fourier domain information for constructing high-resolution images. To further improve representative power, we propose a Cascaded LIT (CLIT) that exploits multi-scale features, along with a cumulative training strategy that gradually increases the upsampling scales during training. We have conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of these components and analyze various training strategies. The qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that LIT and CLIT achieve favorable results and outperform the prior works in arbitrary super-resolution tasks.

        **Abstract**:

        Cameras and image-editing software often process images in the wide-gamut ProPhoto color space, encompassing 90% of all visible colors. However, when images are encoded for sharing, this color-rich representation is transformed and clipped to fit within the small-gamut standard RGB (sRGB) color space, representing only 30% of visible colors. Recovering the lost color information is challenging due to the clipping procedure. Inspired by neural implicit representations for 2D images, we propose a method that optimizes a lightweight multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) model during the gamut reduction step to predict the clipped values. GamutMLP takes approximately 2 seconds to optimize and requires only 23 KB of storage. The small memory footprint allows our GamutMLP model to be saved as metadata in the sRGB image‚Äîthe model can be extracted when needed to restore wide-gamut color values. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for color recovery and compare it with alternative strategies, including pre-trained DNN-based gamut expansion networks and other implicit neural representation methods. As part of this effort, we introduce a new color gamut dataset of 2200 wide-gamut/small-gamut images for training and testing.

        **Abstract**:

        The aim of this paper is to propose a mechanism to efficiently and explicitly model image hierarchies in the global, regional, and local range for image restoration. To achieve that, we start by analyzing two important properties of natural images including cross-scale similarity and anisotropic image features. Inspired by that, we propose the anchored stripe self-attention which achieves a good balance between the space and time complexity of self-attention and the modelling capacity beyond the regional range. Then we propose a new network architecture dubbed GRL to explicitly model image hierarchies in the Global, Regional, and Local range via anchored stripe self-attention, window self-attention, and channel attention enhanced convolution. Finally, the proposed network is applied to 7 image restoration types, covering both real and synthetic settings. The proposed method sets the new state-of-the-art for several of those. Code will be available at https://github.com/ofsoundof/GRL-Image-Restoration.git.

        **Abstract**:

        We present a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training method for image harmonization which can leverage large-scale unannotated image datasets. To achieve this goal, we first generate pre-training data online with our Label-Efficient Masked Region Transform (LEMaRT) pipeline. Given an image, LEMaRT generates a foreground mask and then applies a set of transformations to perturb various visual attributes, e.g., defocus blur, contrast, saturation, of the region specified by the generated mask. We then pre-train image harmonization models by recovering the original image from the perturbed image. Secondly, we introduce an image harmonization model, namely SwinIH, by retrofitting the Swin Transformer [27] with a combination of local and global self-attention mechanisms. Pre-training SwinIH with LEMaRT results in a new state of the art for image harmonization, while being label-efficient, i.e., consuming less annotated data for fine-tuning than existing methods. Notably, on iHarmony4 dataset [8], SwinIH outperforms the state of the art, i.e., SCS-Co [16] by a margin of 0.4 dB when it is fine-tuned on only 50% of the training data, and by 1.0 dB when it is trained on the full training dataset.

        **Abstract**:

        Content affinity loss including feature and pixel affinity is a main problem which leads to artifacts in photorealistic and video style transfer. This paper proposes a new framework named CAP-VSTNet, which consists of a new reversible residual network and an unbiased linear transform module, for versatile style transfer. This reversible residual network can not only preserve content affinity but not introduce redundant information as traditional reversible networks, and hence facilitate better stylization. Empowered by Matting Laplacian training loss which can address the pixel affinity loss problem led by the linear transform, the proposed framework is applicable and effective on versatile style transfer. Extensive experiments show that CAP-VSTNet can produce better qualitative and quantitative results in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

        **Abstract**:

        Object compositing based on 2D images is a challenging problem since it typically involves multiple processing stages such as color harmonization, geometry correction and shadow generation to generate realistic results. Furthermore, annotating training data pairs for compositing requires substantial manual effort from professionals, and is hardly scalable. Thus, with the recent advances in generative models, in this work, we propose a selfsupervised framework for object compositing by leveraging the power of conditional diffusion models. Our framework can hollistically address the object compositing task in a unified model, transforming the viewpoint, geometry, color and shadow of the generated object while requiring no manual labeling. To preserve the input object's characteristics, we introduce a content adaptor that helps to maintain categori-cal semantics and object appearance. A data augmentation method is further adopted to improve the fidelity of the generator. Our method outperforms relevant baselines in both realism and faithfulness of the synthesized result images in a user study on various real-world images.

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01757](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01757)

        **Abstract**:

        Vector font synthesis is a challenging and ongoing problem in the fields of Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. The recently-proposed DeepVecFont [27] achieved state-of-the-art performance by exploiting information of both the image and sequence modalities of vector fonts. However, it has limited capability for handling long sequence data and heavily relies on an image-guided outline refinement post-processing. Thus, vector glyphs synthesized by DeepVecFont still often contain some distortions and artifacts and cannot rival human-designed results. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an enhanced version of DeepVecFont mainly by making the following three novel technical contributions. First, we adopt Transformers instead of RNNs to process sequential data and design a relaxation representation for vector outlines, markedly improving the model's capability and stability of synthesizing long and complex outlines. Second, we propose to sample auxiliary points in addition to control points to precisely align the generated and target B√©zier curves or lines. Finally, to alleviate error accumulation in the sequential generation process, we develop a context-based self-refinement module based on another Transformer-based decoder to remove artifacts in the initially synthesized glyphs. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively resolves those intrinsic problems of the original DeepVecFont and outperforms existing approaches in generating English and Chinese vector fonts with complicated structures and diverse styles.

        **Abstract**:

        Transformer-based models achieve favorable performance in artistic style transfer recently thanks to its global receptive field and powerful multi-head/layer attention operations. Nevertheless, the over-paramerized multi-layer structure increases parameters significantly and thus presents a heavy burden for training. Moreover, for the task of style transfer, vanilla Transformer that fuses content and style features by residual connections is prone to content-wise distortion. In this paper, we devise a novel Transformer model termed as Master specifically for style transfer. On the one hand, in the proposed model, different Transformer layers share a common group of parameters, which (1) reduces the total number of parameters, (2) leads to more robust training convergence, and (3) is readily to control the degree of stylization via tuning the number of stacked layers freely during inference. On the other hand, different from the vanilla version, we adopt a learnable scaling operation on content features before content-style feature interaction, which better preserves the original similarity between a pair of content features while ensuring the stylization quality. We also propose a novel meta learning scheme for the proposed model so that it can not only work in the typical setting of arbitrary style transfer, but also adaptable to the few-shot setting, by only fine-tuning the Transformer encoder layer in the few-shot stage for one specific style. Text-guided few-shot style transfer is firstly achieved with the proposed framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Master under both zero-shot and few-shot style transfer settings.

        **Abstract**:

        Recent works have demonstrated that natural language can be used to generate and edit 3D shapes. However, these methods generate shapes with limited fidelity and diversity. We introduce CLIP-Sculptor, a method to address these constraints by producing high-fidelity and diverse 3D shapes without the need for (text, shape) pairs during training. CLIP-Sculptor achieves this in a multi-resolution approach that first generates in a low-dimensional latent space and then upscales to a higher resolution for improved shape fidelity. For improved shape diversity, we use a discrete latent space which is modeled using a transformer conditioned on CLIP's image-text embedding space. We also present a novel variant of classifier-free guidance, which improves the accuracy-diversity trade-off. Finally, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating that CLIP-Sculptor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

        **Abstract**:

        Automatic layout generation that can synthesize high-quality layouts is an important tool for graphic design in many applications. Though existing methods based on generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) have progressed, they still leave much room for improving the quality and diversity of the results. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in generating high-quality images, this paper explores their potential for conditional layout generation and proposes Transformer-based Layout Diffusion Model (LayoutDM) by instantiating the conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) with a purely transformer-based architecture. Instead of using convolutional neural networks, a transformer-based conditional Layout Denoiser is proposed to learn the reverse diffusion process to generate samples from noised layout data. Benefitting from both transformer and DDPM, our LayoutDM is of desired properties such as high-quality generation, strong sample diversity, faithful distribution coverage, and stationary training in comparison to GANs and VAEs. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art generative models in terms of quality and diversity.

        **Abstract**:

        Text-guided image editing can have a transformative impact in supporting creative applications. A key challenge is to generate edits that are faithful to input text prompts, while consistent with input images. We present Imagen Editor, a cascaded diffusion model built, by fine-tuning Imagen [36] on text-guided image inpainting. Imagen Editor's edits are faithful to the text prompts, which is accomplished by using object detectors to propose inpainting masks during training. In addition, Imagen Editor captures fine details in the input image by conditioning the cascaded pipeline on the original high resolution image. To improve qualitative and quantitative evaluation, we introduce EditBench, a systematic benchmark for text-guided image inpainting. EditBench evaluates inpainting edits on natural and generated images exploring objects, attributes, and scenes. Through extensive human evaluation on EditBench, we find that object-masking during training leads to across-the-board improvements in text-image alignment ‚Äì such that Imagen Editor is preferred over DALL-E 2 [31] and Stable Diffusion [33] ‚Äì and, as a cohort, these models are better at object-rendering than text-rendering, and handle material/color/size attributes better than count/shape attributes.

        **Abstract**:

        Recent text-to-image diffusion models are able to generate convincing results of unprecedented quality. However, it is nearly impossible to control the shapes of different regions/objects or their layout in a fine-grained fashion. Previous attempts to provide such controls were hindered by their reliance on a fixed set of labels. To this end, we present SpaText ‚Äî a new method for text-to-image generation using open-vocabulary scene control. In addition to a global text prompt that describes the entire scene, the user provides a segmentation map where each region of interest is annotated by a free-form natural language description. Due to lack of large-scale datasets that have a detailed textual description for each region in the image, we choose to leverage the current large-scale text-to-image datasets and base our approach on a novel CLIP-based spatio-textual representation, and show its effectiveness on two state-of-the-art diffusion models: pixel-based and latent-based. In addition, we show how to extend the classifier-free guidance method in diffusion models to the multi-conditional case and present an alternative accelerated inference algorithm. Finally, we offer several automatic evaluation metrics and use them, in addition to FID scores and a user study, to evaluate our method and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on image generation with free-form textual scene control.

        **Abstract**:

        Language-guided image editing has achieved great success recently. In this paper, we investigate exemplar-guided image editing for more precise control. We achieve this goal by leveraging self-supervised training to disentangle and re-organize the source image and the exemplar. However, the naive approach will cause obvious fusing artifacts. We carefully analyze it and propose a content bottleneck and strong augmentations to avoid the trivial solution of directly copying and pasting the exemplar image. Meanwhile, to ensure the controllability of the editing process, we design an arbitrary shape mask for the exemplar image and leverage the classifier-free guidance to increase the similarity to the exemplar image. The whole framework involves a single forward of the diffusion model without any iterative optimization. We demonstrate that our method achieves an impressive performance and enables controllable editing on in-the-wild images with high fidelity. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example.

        **Abstract**:

        We propose a method for editing images from human instructions: given an input image and a written instruction that tells the model what to do, our model follows these instructions to edit the image. To obtain training data for this problem, we combine the knowledge of two large pretrained models‚Äîa language model (GPT-3) and a text-to-image model (Stable Diffusion)‚Äîto generate a large dataset of image editing examples. Our conditional diffusion model, InstructPix2Pix, is trained on our generated data, and generalizes to real images and user-written instructions at inference time. Since it performs edits in the forward pass and does not require per-example fine-tuning or inversion, our model edits images quickly, in a matter of seconds. We show compelling editing results for a diverse collection of input images and written instructions.

        **Abstract**:

        Conditional graphic layout generation, which generates realistic layouts according to user constraints, is a challenging task that has not been well-studied yet. First, there is limited discussion about how to handle diverse user constraints flexibly and uniformly. Second, to make the layouts conform to user constraints, existing work often sacrifices generation quality significantly. In this work, we propose LayoutFormer++ to tackle the above problems. First, to flexibly handle diverse constraints, we propose a constraint serialization scheme, which represents different user constraints as sequences of tokens with a predefined format. Then, we formulate conditional layout generation as a sequence-to-sequence transformation, and leverage encoder-decoder framework with Transformer as the basic architecture. Furthermore, to make the layout better meet user requirements without harming quality, we propose a decoding space restriction strategy. Specifically, we prune the predicted distribution by ignoring the options that definitely violate user constraints and likely result in low-quality layouts, and make the model samples from the restricted distribution. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutFormer++ outperforms existing approaches on all the tasks in terms of both better generation quality and less constraint violation.

        **Abstract**:

        Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in image generation quality, especially when guidance is used to control the generative process. However, guidance requires a large amount of image-annotation pairs for training and is thus dependent on their availability and correctness. In this paper, we eliminate the need for such annotation by instead exploiting the flexibility of self-supervision signals to design a framework for self-guided diffusion models. By leveraging a feature extraction function and a self-annotation function, our method provides guidance signals at various image granularities: from the level of holistic images to object boxes and even segmentation masks. Our experiments on single-label and multi-label image datasets demonstrate that self-labeled guidance always outperforms diffusion models without guidance and may even surpass guidance based on ground-truth labels. When equipped with self-supervised box or mask proposals, our method further generates visually diverse yet semantically consistent images, without the need for any class, box, or segment label annotation. Self-guided diffusion is simple, flexible and expected to profit from deployment at scale.

        **Abstract**:

        Diffusion models have emerged as the best approach for generative modeling of 2D images. Part of their success is due to the possibility of training them on millions if not billions of images with a stable learning objective. However, extending these models to 3D remains difficult for two reasons. First, finding a large quantity of 3D training data is much more complex than for 2D images. Second, while it is conceptually trivial to extend the models to operate on 3D rather than 2D grids, the associated cubic growth in memory and compute complexity makes this infeasible. We address the first challenge by introducing a new diffusion setup that can be trained, end-to-end, with only posed 2D images for supervision; and the second challenge by proposing an image formation model that decouples model memory from spatial memory. We evaluate our method on real-world data, using the CO3D dataset which has not been used to train 3D generative models before. We show that our diffusion models are scalable, train robustly, and are competitive in terms of sample quality and fidelity to existing approaches for 3D generative modeling.

        **Abstract**:

        Diffusion-based models have shown the merits of generating high-quality visual data while preserving better diversity in recent studies. However, such observation is only justified with curated data distribution, where the data samples are nicely pre-processed to be uniformly distributed in terms of their labels. In practice, a long-tailed data distribution appears more common and how diffusion models perform on such classimbalanced data remains unknown. In this work, we first investigate this problem and observe significant degradation in both diversity and fidelity when the diffusion model is trained on datasets with classimbalanced distributions. Especially in tail classes, the generations largely lose diversity and we observe severe mode-collapse issues. To tackle this problem, we set from the hypothesis that the data distribution is not class-balanced, and propose Class-Balancing Diffusion Models (CBDM) that are trained with a distribution adjustment regularizer as a solution. Experiments show that images generated by CBDM exhibit higher diversity and quality in both quantitative and qualitative ways. Our method benchmarked the generation results on CIFAR100/CIFAR100LT dataset and shows out-standing performance on the downstream recognition task.

        **Abstract**:

        Conditional image-to-video (cI2V) generation aims to synthesize a new plausible video starting from an image (e.g., a person's face) and a condition (e.g., an action class label like smile). The key challenge of the cI2V task lies in the simultaneous generation of realistic spatial appearance and temporal dynamics corresponding to the given image and condition. In this paper, we propose an approach for cI2V using novel latent flow diffusion models (LFDM) that synthesize an optical flow sequence in the latent space based on the given condition to warp the given image. Compared to previous direct-synthesis-based works, our proposed LFDM can better synthesize spatial details and temporal motion by fully utilizing the spatial content of the given image and warping it in the latent space according to the generated temporally-coherent flow. The training of LFDM consists of two separate stages: (1) an unsupervised learning stage to train a latent flow auto-encoder for spatial content generation, including a flow predictor to estimate latent flow between pairs of video frames, and (2) a conditional learning stage to train a 3D-UNet-based diffusion model (DM) for temporal latent flow generation. Unlike previous DMs operating in pixel space or latent feature space that couples spatial and temporal information, the DM in our LFDM only needs to learn a low-dimensional latent flow space for motion generation, thus being more computationally efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, where LFDM consistently outperforms prior arts. Furthermore, we show that LFDM can be easily adapted to new domains by simply finetuning the image decoder. Our code is available at https://github.com/nihaomiao/CVPR23_LFDM.

        **Abstract**:

        Despite the remarkable progress in deep generative models, synthesizing high-resolution and temporally coherent videos still remains a challenge due to their high-dimensionality and complex temporal dynamics along with large spatial variations. Recent works on diffusion models have shown their potential to solve this challenge, yet they suffer from severe computation and memory-inefficiency that limit the scalability. To handle this issue, we propose a novel generative model for videos, coined projected latent video diffusion model (PVDM), a probabilistic diffusion model which learns a video distribution in a low-dimensional latent space and thus can be efficiently trained with high-resolution videos under limited resources. Specifically, PVDM is composed of two components: (a) an autoencoder that projects a given video as 2D-shaped latent vectors that factorize the complex cubic structure of video pixels and (b) a diffusion model architecture specialized for our new factorized latent space and the training/sampling procedure to synthesize videos of arbitrary length with a single model. Experiments on popular video generation datasets demonstrate the superiority of PVDM compared with previous video synthesis methods; e.g., PVDM obtains the FVD score of 639.7 on the UCF-101 long video (128 frames) generation benchmark, which improves 1773.4 of the prior state-of-the-art.

        **Abstract**:

        Quantizing images into discrete representations has been a fundamental problem in unified generative modeling. Predominant approaches learn the discrete representation either in a deterministic manner by selecting the best-matching token or in a stochastic manner by sampling from a predicted distribution. However, deterministic quantization suffers from severe codebook collapse and misalignment with inference stage while stochastic quantization suffers from low codebook utilization and perturbed reconstruction objective. This paper presents a regularized vector quantization framework that allows to mitigate above issues effectively by applying regularization from two perspectives. The first is a prior distribution regularization which measures the discrepancy between a prior token distribution and the predicted token distribution to avoid code-book collapse and low codebook utilization. The second is a stochastic mask regularization that introduces stochasticity during quantization to strike a good balance between inference stage misalignment and unperturbed reconstruction objective. In addition, we design a probabilistic contrastive loss which serves as a calibrated metric to further mitigate the perturbed reconstruction objective. Extensive experiments show that the proposed quantization framework outperforms prevailing vector quantization methods consistently across different generative models including auto-regressive models and diffusion models.

        **Abstract**:

        Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) uses a twodimensional detector to capture consecutive video frames during a single exposure time. Following this, an efficient reconstruction algorithm needs to be designed to reconstruct the desired video frames. Although recent deep learning-based state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction algorithms have achieved good results in most tasks, they still face the following challenges due to excessive model complexity and GPU memory limitations: 1) these models need high computational cost, and 2) they are usually unable to reconstruct large-scale video frames at high compression ratios. To address these issues, we develop an efficient network for video SCI by using dense connections and space-time factorization mechanism within a single residual block, dubbed EfficientSCI. The EfficientSCI network can well establish spatial-temporal correlation by using convolution in the spatial domain and Transformer in the temporal domain, respectively. We are the first time to show that an UHD color video with high compression ratio can be reconstructed from a snapshot 2D measurement using a single end-to-end deep learning model with PSNR above 32 dB. Extensive results on both simulation and real data show that our method significantly outperforms all previous SOTA algorithms with better real-time performance.

        **Abstract**:

        Learning-based video compression has been extensively studied over the past years, but it still has limitations in adapting to various motion patterns and entropy models. In this paper, we propose multi-mode video compression (MMVC), a block wise mode ensemble deep video compression framework that selects the optimal mode for feature domain prediction adapting to different motion patterns. Proposed multi-modes include ConvLSTM-based feature domain prediction, optical flow conditioned feature domain prediction, and feature propagation to address a wide range of cases from static scenes without apparent motions to dynamic scenes with a moving camera. We partition the feature space into blocks for temporal prediction in spatial block-based representations. For entropy coding, we consider both dense and sparse post-quantization residual blocks, and apply optional run-length coding to sparse residuals to improve the compression rate. In this sense, our method uses a dual-mode entropy coding scheme guided by a binary density map, which offers significant rate reduction surpassing the extra cost of transmitting the binary selection map. We validate our scheme with some of the most popular benchmarking datasets. Compared with state-of-the-art video compression schemes and standard codecs, our method yields better or competitive results measured with PSNR and MS-SSIM.

        **Authors**: *Carlos Gomes, Roberto Azevedo, Christopher Schroers*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01774](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01774)

        **Abstract**:

        Encoding videos as neural networks is a recently proposed approach that allows new forms of video processing. However, traditional techniques still outperform such neural video representation (NVR) methods for the task of video compression. This performance gap can be explained by the fact that current NVR methods: i) use architectures that do not efficiently obtain a compact representation of temporal and spatial information; and ii) minimize rate and distortion disjointly (first overfitting a network on a video and then using heuristic techniques such as post-training quantization or weight pruning to compress the model). We propose a novel convolutional architecture for video representation that better represents spatio-temporal information and a training strategy capable of jointly optimizing rate and distortion. All network and quantization parameters are jointly learned end-to-end, and the post-training operations used in previous works are unnecessary. We evaluate our method on the UVG dataset, achieving new state-of-the-art results for video compression with NVRs. Moreover, we deliver the first NVR-based video compression method that improves over the typically adopted HEVC benchmark (x265, disabled b-frames, ‚Äúmedium‚Äù preset), closing the gap to autoencoder-based video compression techniques.

        **Abstract**:

        Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently advanced numerous vision-related areas. INR performance depends strongly on the choice of activation function employed in its MLP network. A wide range of nonlinearities have been explored, but, unfortunately, current INRs designed to have high accuracy also suffer from poor robustness (to signal noise, parameter variation, etc.). Inspired by harmonic analysis, we develop a new, highly accurate and robust INR that does not exhibit this trade off. Our Wavelet Implicit neural REpresentation (WIRE) uses as its activation function the complex Gabor wavelet that is well-known to be optimally concentrated in space-frequency and to have excellent biases for representing images. A wide range of experiments (image denoising, image inpainting, super-resolution, computed tomography reconstruction, image over fitting, and novel view synthesis with neural radiance fields) demonstrate that WIRE defines the new state of the art in INR accuracy, training time, and robustness.

        **Abstract**:

        Implicit neural representation (INR) can describe the target scenes with high fidelity using a small number of parameters, and is emerging as a promising data compression technique. However, limited spectrum coverage is intrinsic to INR, and it is non-trivial to remove redundancy in diverse complex data effectively. Preliminary studies can only exploit either global or local correlation in the target data and thus of limited performance. In this paper, we propose a Tree-structured Implicit Neural Compression (TINC) to conduct compact representation for local regions and extract the shared features of these local representations in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, we use Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to fit the partitioned local regions, and these MLPs are organized in tree structure to share parameters according to the spatial distance. The parameter sharing scheme not only ensures the continuity between adjacent regions, but also jointly removes the local and non-local redundancy. Extensive experiments show that TINC improves the compression fidelity of INR, and has shown impressive compression capabilities over commercial tools and other deep learning based methods. Besides, the approach is of high flexibility and can be tailored for different data and parameter settings. The source code can be found at https://github.com/RichealYoung/TINC.

        **Abstract**:

        Given sparse depths and the corresponding RGB images, depth completion aims at spatially propagating the sparse measurements throughout the whole image to get a dense depth prediction. Despite the tremendous progress of deep-learning-based depth completion methods, the locality of the convolutional layer or graph model makes it hard for the network to model the long-range relationship between pixels. While recent fully Transformer-based architecture has reported encouraging results with the global receptive field, the performance and efficiency gaps to the well-developed CNN models still exist because of its deteriorative local feature details. This paper proposes a Joint Convolutional Attention and Transformer block (JCAT), which deeply couples the convolutional attention layer and Vision Transformer into one block, as the basic unit to construct our depth completion model in a pyramidal structure. This hybrid architecture naturally benefits both the local connec-tivity of convolutions and the global context of the Trans-former in one single model. As a result, our Completion-Former outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs-based methods on the outdoor KITTI Depth Completion benchmark and indoor NYUv2 dataset, achieving significantly higher effi-ciency (nearly 1/3 FLOPs) compared to pure Transformer-based methods.

        **Abstract**:

        Self-supervised monocular depth estimation that does not require ground truth for training has attracted attention in recent years. It is of high interest to design lightweight but effective models so that they can be deployed on edge devices. Many existing architectures benefit from using heavier backbones at the expense of model sizes. This paper achieves comparable results with a lightweight architecture. Specifically, the efficient combination of CNNs and Transformers is investigated, and a hybrid architecture called Lite-Mono is presented. A Consecutive Dilated Convolutions (CDC) module and a Local-Global Features Interaction (LGFI) module are proposed. The former is used to extract rich multi-scale local features, and the latter takes advantage of the self-attention mechanism to encode long-range global information into the features. Experiments demonstrate that Lite-Mono outperforms Monodepth2 by a large margin in accuracy, with about 80% fewer trainable parameters. Our codes and models are available at https://github.com/noahzn/Lite-Mono.

        **Abstract**:

        Transformers yield state-of-the-art results across many tasks. However, their heuristically designed architecture impose huge computational costs during inference. This work aims on challenging the common design philosophy of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model with uniform dimension across all the stacked blocks in a model stage, where we redistribute the parameters both across transformer blocks and between different structures within the block via the first systematic attempt on global structural pruning. Dealing with diverse ViT structural components, we derive a novel Hessian-based structural pruning criteria comparable across all layers and structures, with latency-aware regularization for direct latency reduction. Performing iterative pruning on the DeiT-Base model leads to a new architecture family called NViT (Novel ViT), with a novel parameter redistribution that utilizes parameters more efficiently. On ImageNet-1K, NViT-Base achieves a

-time speedup over the DeiT-Base model in a near lossless manner. Smaller NViT variants achieve more than 1% accuracy gain at the same throughput of the DeiT Small/Tiny variants, as well as a lossless

 reduction over the SWIN-Small model. These results outperform prior art by a large margin. Further analysis is provided on the parameter redistribution insight of NViT, where we show the high prunability of ViT models, distinct sensitivity within ViT block, and unique parameter distribution trend across stacked ViT blocks. Our insights provide viability for a simple yet effective parameter redistribution rule towards more efficient ViTs for off-the-shelf performance boost.

        **Abstract**:

        Recent DEtection TRansformer-based (DETR) models have obtained remarkable performance. Its success cannot be achieved without the re-introduction of multi-scale feature fusion in the encoder. However, the excessively increased tokens in multi-scale features, especially for about 75% of low-level features, are quite computationally inefficient, which hinders real applications of DETR models. In this paper, we present Lite DETR, a simple yet efficient end-to-end object detection framework that can effectively reduce the GFLOPs of the detection head by 60% while keeping 99% of the original performance. Specifically, we design an efficient encoder block to update high-level features (corresponding to small-resolution feature maps) and low-level features (corresponding to large-resolution feature maps) in an interleaved way. In addition, to better fuse cross-scale features, we develop a key-aware deformable attention to predict more reliable attention weights. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed Lite DETR, and the efficient encoder strategy can generalize well across existing DETR-based models. The code will be available in https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Lite-DETR.

        **Abstract**:

        Vision Transformers (ViTs) are built on the assumption of treating image patches as ‚Äúvisual tokens‚Äù and learn patch-to-patch attention. The patch embedding based tokenizer has a semantic gap with respect to its counterpart, the textual tokenizer. The patch-to-patch attention suffers from the quadratic complexity issue, and also makes it non-trivial to explain learned ViTs. To address these issues in ViT, this paper proposes to learn Patch-to-Cluster attention (PaCa) in ViT. Queries in our PaCa-ViT starts with patches, while keys and values are directly based on clustering (with a predefined small number of clusters). The clusters are learned end-to-end, leading to better tokenizers and inducing joint clustering-for-attention and attention-for-clustering for better and interpretable models. The quadratic complexity is relaxed to linear complexity. The proposed PaCa module is used in designing efficient and interpretable ViT backbones and semantic segmentation head networks. In experiments, the proposed methods are tested on ImageNet-1k image classification, MS-COCO object detection and instance segmentation and MIT-ADE20k semantic segmentation. Compared with the prior art, it obtains better performance in all the three benchmarks than the SWin [32] and the PVTs [47], [48] by significant margins in ImageNet-1k and MIT-ADE20k. It is also significantly more efficient than PVT models in MS-COCO and MIT-ADE20k due to the linear complexity. The learned clusters are semantically meaningful.

        **Abstract**:

        Formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) has been shown to be an effective method for pre-training vision transformers, where ExFractalDB-21k was shown to exceed the pre-training effect of ImageNet-21k. These studies also indicate that contours mattered more than textures when pre-training vision transformers. However, the lack of a systematic investigation as to why these contour-oriented synthetic datasets can achieve the same accuracy as real datasets leaves much room for skepticism. In the present work, we develop a novel methodology based on circular harmonics for systematically investigating the design space of contour-oriented synthetic datasets. This allows us to efficiently search the optimal range of FDSL parameters and maximize the variety of synthetic images in the dataset, which we found to be a critical factor. When the resulting new dataset VisualAtom-21k is used for pre-training ViT-Base, the top-1 accuracy reached 83.7% when fine-tuning on ImageNet-1k. This is only 0.5% difference from the top-1 accuracy (84.2%) achieved by the JFT-300M pre-training, even though the scale of images is 1/14. Unlike JFT-300M which is a static dataset, the quality of synthetic datasets will continue to improve, and the current work is a testament to this possibility. FDSL is also free of the common issues associated with real images, e.g. privacy/copyright issues, labeling costs/errors, and ethical biases.

        **Abstract**:

        Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology has drawn increasing attention in recent years. It can extract Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) from facial videos, making many applications like health monitoring and emotional analysis more accessible. However, as the BVP signal is easily affected by environmental changes, existing methods struggle to generalize well for unseen domains. In this paper, we systematically address the domain shift problem in the rPPG measurement task. We show that most domain generalization methods do not work well in this problem, as domain labels are ambiguous in complicated environmental changes. In light of this, we propose a domain-label-free approach called NEuron STructure modeling (NEST). NEST improves the generalization capacity by maximizing the coverage of feature space during training, which reduces the chance for under-optimized feature activation during inference. Besides, NEST can also enrich and enhance domain invariant features across multi-domain. We create and benchmark a large-scale domain generalization protocol for the rPPG measurement task. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset settings. The codes are available at https://github.com/LuPaoPao/NEST.

        **Abstract**:

        Image classifiers are known to be difficult to interpret and therefore require explanation methods to understand their decisions. We present ShearletX, a novel mask explanation method for image classifiers based on the shearlet transform - a multiscale directional image representation. Current mask explanation methods are regularized by smoothness constraints that protect against undesirable fine-grained explanation artifacts. However, the smoothness of a mask limits its ability to separate fine-detail patterns, that are relevant for the classifier, from nearby nuisance patterns, that do not affect the classifier. ShearletX solves this problem by avoiding smoothness regularization all together, replacing it by shearlet sparsity constraints. The resulting explanations consist of a few edges, textures, and smooth parts of the original image, that are the most relevant for the decision of the classifier. To support our method, we propose a mathematical definition for explanation artifacts and an information theoretic score to evaluate the quality of mask explanations. We demonstrate the superiority of ShearletX over previous mask based explanation methods using these new metrics, and present exemplary situations where separating fine-detail patterns allows explaining phenomena that were not explainable before.

        **Abstract**:

        In this paper, we present an integral pre-training framework based on masked image modeling (MIM). We advocate for pre-training the backbone and neck jointly so that the transfer gap between MIM and downstream recognition tasks is minimal. We make two technical contributions. First, we unify the reconstruction and recognition necks by inserting a feature pyramid into the pre-training stage. Second, we complement mask image modeling (MIM) with masked feature modeling (MFM) that offers multi-stage supervision to the feature pyramid. The pre-trained models, termed integrally pre-trained transformer pyramid networks (iTPNs), serve as powerful foundation models for visual recognition. In particular, the base/large-level iTPN achieves an 86.2%/87.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, a 53.2%/55.6% box AP on COCO object detection with 1√ó training schedule using Mask-RCNN, and a 54.7%/57.7% mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation using UPerHead ‚Äì all these results set new records. Our work inspires the community to work on unifying upstream pre-training and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Code is available at github.com/sunsmarterjie/iTPN.

        **Abstract**:

        Modern data augmentation using a mixture-based technique can regularize the models from overfitting to the training data in various computer vision applications, but a proper data augmentation technique tailored for the part-based Visible-Infrared person Re-IDentification (VI-ReID) models remains unexplored. In this paper, we present a novel data augmentation technique, dubbed PartMix, that synthesizes the augmented samples by mixing the part descriptors across the modalities to improve the performance of part-based VI-ReID models. Especially, we synthesize the positive and negative samples within the same and across different identities and regularize the backbone model through contrastive learning. In addition, we also present an entropy-based mining strategy to weaken the adverse impact of unreliable positive and negative samples. When incorporated into existing part-based VI-ReID model, PartMix consistently boosts the performance. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our PartMix over the existing VI-ReID methods and provide ablation studies.

        **Abstract**:

        Knowledge distillation facilitates the training of a compact student network by using a deep teacher one. While this has achieved great success in many tasks, it remains completely unstudied for image-based 6D object pose estimation. In this work, we introduce the first knowledge distillation method driven by the 6D pose estimation task. To this end, we observe that most modern 6D pose estimation frameworks output local predictions, such as sparse 2D keypoints or dense representations, and that the compact student network typically struggles to predict such local quantities precisely. Therefore, instead of imposing prediction-to-prediction supervision from the teacher to the student, we propose to distill the teacher's distribution of local predictions into the student network, facilitating its training. Our experiments on several benchmarks show that our distillation method yields state-of-the-art results with different compact student models and for both keypoint-based and dense prediction-based architectures.

        ## [1775] Focused and Collaborative Feedback Integration for Interactive Image Segmentation

        **Authors**: *Qiaoqiao Wei, Hui Zhang, Jun-Hai Yong*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01788](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01788)

        **Abstract**:

        Interactive image segmentation aims at obtaining a segmentation mask for an image using simple user annotations. During each round of interaction, the segmentation result from the previous round serves as feedback to guide the user's annotation and provides dense prior information for the segmentation model, effectively acting as a bridge between interactions. Existing methods overlook the importance of feedback or simply concatenate it with the original input, leading to underutilization of feedback and an increase in the number of required annotations. To address this, we propose an approach called Focused and Collaborative Feedback Integration (FCFI) to fully exploit the feedback for click-based interactive image segmentation. FCFI first focuses on a local area around the new click and corrects the feedback based on the similarities of high-level features. It then alternately and collaboratively updates the feedback and deep features to integrate the feedback into the features. The efficacy and efficiency of FCFI were validated on four benchmarks, namely GrabCut, Berkeley, SBD, and DAVIS. Experimental results show that FCFI achieved new state-of-the-art performance with less computational overhead than previous methods.

        **Abstract**:

        In this work, instead of directly predicting the pixel-level segmentation masks, the problem of referring image seg-mentation is formulated as sequential polygon generation, and the predicted polygons can be later converted into segmentation masks. This is enabled by a new sequence-to-sequence framework, Polygon Transformer (PolyFormer), which takes a sequence of image patches and text query to-kens as input, and outputs a sequence of polygon vertices autoregressively. For more accurate geometric localization, we propose a regression-based decoder, which predicts the precise floating-point coordinates directly, without any co-ordinate quantization error. In the experiments, PolyFormer outperforms the prior art by a clear margin, e.g., 5.40% and 4.52% absolute improvements on the challenging Re-fCOCO+ and RefCOCOg datasets. It also shows strong generalization ability when evaluated on the referring video segmentation task without fine-tuning, e.g., achieving competitive 61.5% J&F on the Ref-DAVIS17 dataset.

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01790](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01790)

        **Abstract**:

        Scene graph generation aims to construct a semantic graph structure from an image such that its nodes and edges respectively represent objects and their relationships. One of the major challenges for the task lies in the presence of distracting objects and relationships in images; contextual reasoning is strongly distracted by irrelevant objects or backgrounds and, more importantly, a vast number of irrelevant candidate relations. To tackle the issue, we propose the Selective Quad Attention Network (SQUAT) that learns to select relevant object pairs and disambiguate them via diverse contextual interactions. SQUAT consists of two main components: edge selection and quad attention. The edge selection module selects relevant object pairs, i.e., edges in the scene graph, which helps contextual reasoning, and the quad attention module then updates the edge features using both edge-to-node and edge-to-edge cross-attentions to capture contextual information between objects and object pairs. Experiments demonstrate the strong performance and robustness of SQUAT, achieving the state of the art on the Visual Genome and Open Images v6 benchmarks.

        **Abstract**:

        Towards building comprehensive real-world visual perception systems, we propose and study a new problem called panoptic scene graph generation (PVSG). PVSG is related to the existing video scene graph generation (VidSGG) problem, which focuses on temporal interactions between humans and objects localized with bounding boxes in videos. However, the limitation of bounding boxes in detecting non-rigid objects and backgrounds often causes VidSGG systems to miss key details that are crucial for comprehensive video understanding. In contrast, PVSG requires nodes in scene graphs to be grounded by more precise, pixel-level segmentation masks, which facilitate holistic scene understanding. To advance research in this new area, we contribute a high-quality PVSG dataset, which consists of 400 videos (289 third-person + 111 egocentric videos) with totally 150K frames labeled with panoptic segmentation masks as well as fine, temporal scene graphs. We also provide a variety of baseline methods and share useful design practices for future work.

        ## [1779] Generalized Relation Modeling for Transformer Tracking

        **Authors**: *Shenyuan Gao, Chunluan Zhou, Jun Zhang*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01792](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01792)

        **Abstract**:

        Compared with previous two-stream trackers, the recent one-stream tracking pipeline, which allows earlier interaction between the template and search region, has achieved a remarkable performance gain. However, existing one-stream trackers always let the template interact with all parts inside the search region throughout all the encoder layers. This could potentially lead to target-background confusion when the extracted feature representations are not sufficiently discriminative. To alleviate this issue, we propose a generalized relation modeling method based on adaptive token division. The proposed method is a generalized formulation of attention-based relation modeling for Transformer tracking, which inherits the merits of both previous two-stream and one-stream pipelines whilst enabling more flexible relation modeling by selecting appropriate search tokens to interact with template tokens. An attention masking strategy and the Gumbel-Softmax technique are introduced to facilitate the parallel computation and end-to-end learning of the token division module. Extensive experiments show that our method is superior to the two-stream and one-stream pipelines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on six challenging benchmarks with a real-time running speed. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Little-Podi/GRM.

        ## [1780] Representation Learning for Visual Object Tracking by Masked Appearance Transfer

        **Authors**: *Haojie Zhao, Dong Wang, Huchuan Lu*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01793](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01793)

        **Abstract**:

        Visual representation plays an important role in visual object tracking. However, few works study the tracking-specified representation learning method. Most trackers directly use ImageNet pre-trained representations. In this paper, we propose masked appearance transfer, a simple but effective representation learning method for tracking, based on an encoder-decoder architecture. First, we encode the visual appearances of the template and search region jointly, and then we decode them separately. During decoding, the original search region image is reconstructed. However, for the template, we make the decoder reconstruct the target appearance within the search region. By this target appearance transfer, the tracking-specified representations are learned. We randomly mask out the inputs, thereby making the learned representations more discriminative. For sufficient evaluation, we design a simple and lightweight tracker that can evaluate the representation for both target localization and box regression. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method is effective, and the learned representations can enable the simple tracker to obtain state-of-the-art performance on six datasets. https://github.com/difhnp/MAT

        **Abstract**:

        The objective of this paper is self-supervised learning of video object segmentation. We develop a unified framework which simultaneously models cross-frame dense correspondence for locally discriminative feature learning and embeds object-level context for target-mask decoding. As a result, it is able to directly learn to perform mask-guided sequential segmentation from unlabeled videos, in contrast to previous efforts usually relying on an oblique solution - cheaply ‚Äúcopying‚Äù labels according to pixel-wise correlations. Concretely, our algorithm alternates between i) clustering video pixels for creating pseudo segmentation labels ex nihilo; and ii) utilizing the pseudo labels to learn mask encoding and decoding for VOS. Unsupervised correspondence learning is further incorporated into this self-taught, mask embedding scheme, so as to ensure the generic nature of the learnt representation and avoid cluster degeneracy. Our algorithm sets state-of-the-arts on two standard benchmarks (i.e., DAVIS
<inf xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">17</inf>
 and YouTube-VOS), narrowing the gap between self- and fully-supervised VOS, in terms of both performance and network architecture design.

        **Abstract**:

        We develop a novel framework for single-scene video anomaly localization that allows for human-understandable reasons for the decisions the system makes. We first learn general representations of objects and their motions (using deep networks) and then use these representations to build a high-level, location-dependent model of any particular scene. This model can be used to detect anomalies in new videos of the same scene. Importantly, our approach is explainable - our high-level appearance and motion features can provide human-understandable reasons for why any part of a video is classified as normal or anomalous. We conduct experiments on standard video anomaly detection datasets (Street Scene, CUHK Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UCSD Ped1, Ped2) and show significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art. All of our code and extra datasets will be made publicly available.

        **Abstract**:

        Motion, scene and object are three primary visual components of a video. In particular, objects represent the foreground, scenes represent the background, and motion traces their dynamics. Based on this insight, we propose a two-stage MOtion, Scene and Object decomposition framework (MOSO)

<sup xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">1</sup>
Codes have been released in https://github.com/iva-mzsun/MOSO for video prediction, consisting of MOSO-VQVAE and MOSO-Transformer. In the first stage, MOSO-VQVAE decomposes a previous video clip into the motion, scene and object components, and represents them as distinct groups of discrete tokens. Then, in the second stage, MOSO-Transformer predicts the object and scene tokens of the subsequent video clip based on the previous tokens and adds dynamic motion at the token level to the generated object and scene tokens. Our framework can be easily extended to unconditional video generation and video frame interpolation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmarks for video prediction and unconditional video generation: BAIR, RoboNet, KTH, KITTI and UCF101. In addition, MOSO can produce realistic videos by combining objects and scenes from different videos.

        **Abstract**:

        The general domain of video segmentation is currently fragmented into different tasks spanning multiple benchmarks. Despite rapid progress in the state-of-the-art, current methods are overwhelmingly task-specific and cannot conceptually generalize to other tasks. Inspired by recent approaches with multi-task capability, we propose TarViS: a novel, unified network architecture that can be applied to any task that requires segmenting a set of arbitrarily defined ‚Äòtargets' in video. Our approach is flexible with respect to how tasks define these targets, since it models the latter as abstract ‚Äòqueries' which are then used to predict pixel-precise target masks. A single TarViS model can be trained jointly on a collection of datasets spanning different tasks, and can hot-swap between tasks during inference without any task-specific retraining. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply TarViS to four different tasks, namely Video Instance Segmentation (VIS), Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), Video Object Segmentation (VOS) and Point Exemplar-guided Tracking (PET). Our unified, jointly trained model achieves state-of-the-art performance on 5/7 benchmarks spanning these four tasks, and competitive performance on the remaining two.

        **Abstract**:

        The ability to distinguish between different movie scenes is critical for understanding the storyline of a movie. However, accurately detecting movie scenes is often challenging as it requires the ability to reason over very long movie segments. This contrasts with most existing video recognition models, which are typically designed for short-range video analysis. This work proposes a State-Space Transformer model that can efficiently capture dependencies in long movie videos for accurate movie scene detection. Our model, called TranS4mer, is built using a novel S4A building block, combining the strengths of structured state-space sequence (S4) and self-attention (A) layers. Given a sequence of frames divided into movie shots (uninterrupted periods where the camera position does not change), the S4A block first applies self-attention to capture short-range intra-shot dependencies. Afterward, the state-space operation in the S4A block aggregates long-range inter-shot cues. The final TranS4mer model, which can be trained end-to-end, is obtained by stacking the S4A blocks one after the other multiple times. Our proposed TranS4mer outperforms all prior methods in three movie scene detection datasets, including MovieNet, BBC, and OVSD, while being 2√ó faster and requiring 3√ó less GPU memory than standard Transformer models. We will release our code and models.

        **Abstract**:

        We present RAFTformer, a realtime action forecasting transformer for latency-aware realworld action forecasting. RAFTformer is a two-stage fully transformer based architecture comprising of a video transformer backbone that operates on high resolution, short-range clips, and a head transformer encoder that temporally aggregates information from multiple short-range clips to span a long-term horizon. Additionally, we propose a novel self-supervised shuffled causal masking scheme as a model level augmentation to improve forecasting fidelity. Finally, we also propose a novel realtime evaluation setting for action fore-casting that directly couples model inference latency to overall forecasting performance and brings forth a hith-erto overlooked trade-off between latency and action fore-casting performance. Our parsimonious network design fa-cilitates RAFTformer inference latency to be 9x smaller than prior works at the same forecasting accuracy. Owing to its two-staged design, RAFTformer uses 94% less training compute and 90% lesser training parameters to outperform prior state-of-the-art baselines by 4.9 points on EGTEA Gaze+ and by 1.4 points on EPIC-Kitchens-100 validation set, as measured by Top-5 recall (T5R) in the offline setting. In the realtime setting, RAFTformer outperforms prior works by an even greater margin of upto 4.4 T5R points on the EPIC-Kitchens-100 dataset.

        **Abstract**:

        Spatiotemporal predictive learning aims to generate future frames by learning from historical frames. In this paper, we investigate existing methods and present a general framework of spatiotemporal predictive learning, in which the spatial encoder and decoder capture intra-frame features and the middle temporal module catches inter-frame correlations. While the mainstream methods employ recurrent units to capture long-term temporal dependencies, they suffer from low computational efficiency due to their unparallelizable architectures. To parallelize the temporal module, we propose the Temporal Attention Unit (TAU), which decomposes temporal attention into intra-frame statical attention and inter-frame dynamical attention. Moreover, while the mean squared error loss focuses on intra-frame errors, we introduce a novel differential divergence regularization to take inter-frame variations into account. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method enables the derived model to achieve competitive performance on various spatiotemporal prediction benchmarks.

        **Abstract**:

        This paper deals with Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) under multimodal input corruption situations where audio inputs and visual inputs are both corrupted, which is not well addressed in previous research directions. Previous studies have focused on how to complement the corrupted audio inputs with the clean visual inputs with the assumption of the availability of clean visual inputs. However, in real life, clean visual inputs are not always accessible and can even be corrupted by occluded lip regions or noises. Thus, we firstly analyze that the previous AVSR models are not indeed robust to the corruption of multimodal input streams, the audio and the visual inputs, compared to uni-modal models. Then, we design multimodal input corruption modeling to develop robust AVSR models. Lastly, we propose a novel AVSR framework, namely Audio-Visual Reliability Scoring module (AV-RelScore), that is robust to the corrupted multimodal inputs. The AV-RelScore can determine which input modal stream is reliable or not for the prediction and also can exploit the more reliable streams in prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated with comprehensive experiments on popular benchmark databases, LRS2 and LRS3. We also show that the reliability scores obtained by AV-RelScore well reflect the degree of corruption and make the proposed model focus on the reliable multimodal representations.

        **Abstract**:

        Prior works on improving speech quality with visual input typically study each type of auditory distortion separately (e.g., separation, inpainting, video-to-speech) and present tailored algorithms. This paper proposes to unify these subjects and study Generalized Speech Regeneration, where the goal is not to reconstruct the exact reference clean signal, but to focus on improving certain aspects of speech while not necessarily preserving the rest such as voice. In particular, this paper concerns intelligibility, quality, and video synchronization. We cast the problem as audio-visual speech resynthesis, which is composed of two steps: pseudo audio-visual speech recognition (P-AVSR) and pseudo text-to-speech synthesis (P-TTS). P-AVSR and P-TTS are connected by discrete units derived from a self-supervised speech model. Moreover, we utilize self-supervised audio-visual speech model to initialize P-AVSR. The proposed model is coined ReVISE. ReVISE is the first high-quality model for in-the-wild video-to-speech synthesis and achieves superior performance on all LRS3 audio-visual regeneration tasks with a single model. To demonstrates its applicability in the real world, ReVISE is also evaluated on EasyCom, an audio-visual benchmark collected under challenging acoustic conditions with only 1.6 hours of training data. Similarly, ReVISE greatly suppresses noise and improves quality. Project page: https://wnhsu.github.io/ReVISE/.

        **Abstract**:

        Recently reported state-of-the-art results in visual speech recognition (VSR) often rely on increasingly large amounts of video data, while the publicly available tran-scribed video datasets are limited in size. In this paper, for the first time, we study the potential of leveraging synthetic visual data for VSR. Our method, termed Synth VSR, sub-stantially improves the performance of VSR systems with synthetic lip movements. The key idea behind Synth VSR is to leverage a speech-driven lip animation model that gen-erates lip movements conditioned on the input speech. The speech-driven lip animation model is trained on an unla-beled audio-visual dataset and could be further optimized towards a pre-trained VSR model when labeled videos are available. As plenty of transcribed acoustic data and face images are available, we are able to generate large-scale synthetic data using the proposed lip animation model for semi-supervised VSR training. We evaluate the performance of our approach on the largest public VSR bench-mark - Lip Reading Sentences 3 (LRS3). Synth VSR achieves a WER of 43.3% with only 30 hours of real labeled data, outperforming off-the-shelf approaches using thousands of hours of video. The WER is further reduced to 27.9% when using all 438 hours of labeled data from LRS3, which is on par with the state-of-the-art self-supervised AV-HuBERT method. Furthermore, when combined with large-scale pseudo-labeled audio-visual data SynthVSR yields a new state-of-the-art VSR WER of 16.9% using publicly available data only, surpassing the recent state-of-the-art approaches trained with 29 times more non-public machine-transcribed video data (90,000 hours). Finally, we perform extensive ablation studies to understand the effect of each component in our proposed method.

        **Abstract**:

        Semi-supervised action recognition is a challenging but critical task due to the high cost of video annotations. Existing approaches mainly use convolutional neural networks, yet current revolutionary vision transformer models have been less explored. In this paper, we investigate the use of transformer models under the SSL setting for action recognition. To this end, we introduce SVFormer, which adopts a steady pseudo-labeling framework (i.e., EMA-Teacher) to cope with unlabeled video samples. While a wide range of data augmentations have been shown effective for semi-supervised image classification, they generally produce limited results for video recognition. We therefore introduce a novel augmentation strategy, Tube Token-Mix, tailored for video data where video clips are mixed via a mask with consistent masked tokens over the temporal axis. In addition, we propose a temporal warping augmentation to cover the complex temporal variation in videos, which stretches selected frames to various temporal durations in the clip. Extensive experiments on three datasets Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51 verify the advantage of SVFormer. In particular, SVFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art by 31.5% with fewer training epochs under the 1% labeling rate of Kinetics-400. Our method can hopefully serve as a strong benchmark and encourage future search on semi-supervised action recognition with Transformer networks.

        With only video-level event labels, this paper targets at the task of weakly-supervised audio-visual event perception (WS-AVEP), which aims to temporally localize and categorize events belonging to each modality. Despite the recent progress, most existing approaches either ignore the unsynchronized property of audio-visual tracks or discount the complementary modality for explicit enhancement. We argue that, for an event residing in one modality, the modality itself should provide ample presence evidence of this event, while the other complementary modality is encouraged to afford the absence evidence as a reference signal. To this end, we propose to collect Cross-Modal Presence-Absence Evidence (CMPAE) in a unified framework. Specifically, by leveraging uni-modal and cross-modal representations, a presence-absence evidence collector (PAEC) is designed under Subjective Logic theory. To learn the evidence in a reliable range, we propose a joint-modal mutual learning (IML) process, which calibrates the evidence of diverse audible, visible, and audi-visible events adaptively and dynamically. Extensive experiments show that our method surpasses state-of-the-arts (e.g., absolute gains of 3.6% and 6.1 % in terms of event-level visual and audio metrics).

        ## [1793] Post-Processing Temporal Action Detection

        **Authors**: *Sauradip Nag, Xiatian Zhu, Yi-Zhe Song, Tao Xiang*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01806](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01806)

        **Abstract**:

        Existing Temporal Action Detection (TAD) methods typically take a pre-processing step in converting an input varying-length video into a fixed-length snippet representation sequence, before temporal boundary estimation and action classification. This pre-processing step would temporally downsample the video, reducing the inference resolution and hampering the detection performance in the original temporal resolution. In essence, this is due to a temporal quantization error introduced during resolution downsampling and recovery. This could negatively impact the TAD performance, but is largely ignored by existing methods. To address this problem, in this work we introduce a novel model-agnostic post-processing method without model redesign and retraining. Specifically, we model the start and end points of action instances with a Gaussian distribution for enabling temporal boundary inference at a sub-snippet level. We further introduce an efficient Taylor-expansion based approximation, dubbed as Gaussian Approximated Post-processing (GAP). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GAP can consistently improve a wide variety of pre-trained off-the-shelf TAD models on the challenging ActivityNet (+0.2%~0. 7% in average mAP) and THUMOS (+0.2%~0.5% in average mAP) benchmarks. Such performance gains are already significant and highly comparable to those achieved by novel model designs. Also, GAP can be integrated with model training for further performance gain. Importantly, GAP enables lower temporal resolutions for more efficient inference, facilitating low-resource application. The code is available at https://github.com/sauradip/GAP

        **Abstract**:

        Supervised learning of skeleton sequence encoders for action recognition has received significant attention in recent times. However, learning such encoders without labels continues to be a challenging problem. While prior works have shown promising results by applying contrastive learning to pose sequences, the quality of the learned representations is often observed to be closely tied to data augmentations that are used to craft the positives. However, augmenting pose sequences is a difficult task as the geometric constraints among the skeleton joints need to be enforced to make the augmentations realistic for that action. In this work, we propose a new contrastive learning approach to train models for skeleton-based action recognition without labels. Our key contribution is a simple module, HaLP - to Hallucinate Latent Positives for contrastive learning. Specifically, HaLP explores the latent space of poses in suitable directions to generate new positives. To this end, we present a novel optimization formulation to solve for the synthetic positives with an explicit control on their hardness. We propose approximations to the objective, making them solvable in closed form with minimal overhead. We show via experiments that using these generated positives within a standard contrastive learning framework leads to consistent improvements across benchmarks such as NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-II on tasks like linear evaluation, transfer learning, and kNN evaluation.

        ## [1795] TriDet: Temporal Action Detection with Relative Boundary Modeling

        **Authors**: *Dingfeng Shi, Yujie Zhong, Qiong Cao, Lin Ma, Jia Li, Dacheng Tao*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01808](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01808)

        **Abstract**:

        In this paper, we present a one-stage framework TriDet for temporal action detection. Existing methods often suffer from imprecise boundary predictions due to the ambiguous action boundaries in videos. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Trident-head to model the action boundary via an estimated relative probability distribution around the boundary. In the feature pyramid of TriDet, we propose an efficient Scalable-Granularity Perception (SGP) layer to mitigate the rank loss problem of self-attention that takes place in the video features and aggregate information across different temporal granularities. Benefiting from the Trident-head and the SGP-based feature pyramid, TriDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmarks: THUMOS14, HACS and EPIC-KITCHEN 100, with lower computational costs, compared to previous methods. For example, TriDet hits an average mAP of 69.3% on THUMOS14, outperforming the previous best by 2.5%, but with only 74.6% of its latency. The code is released to https://github.com/dingfengshi/TriDet.

        ## [1796] Hybrid Active Learning via Deep Clustering for Video Action Detection

        **Authors**: *Aayush Jung Rana, Yogesh S. Rawat*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01809](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01809)

        **Abstract**:

        In this work, we focus on reducing the annotation cost for video action detection which requires costly frame-wise dense annotations. We study a novel hybrid active learning (AL) strategy which performs efficient labeling using both intra-sample and inter-sample selection. The intra-sample selection leads to labeling of fewer frames in a video as opposed to inter-sample selection which operates at video level. This hybrid strategy reduces the annotation cost from two different aspects leading to significant labeling cost reduction. The proposed approach utilize Clustering-Aware Uncertainty Scoring (CLAUS), a novel label acquisition strategy which relies on both informativeness and diversity for sample selection. We also propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Weighted (STeW) loss formulation, which helps in model training under limited annotations. The proposed approach is evaluated on UCF-101-24 and J-HMDB-21 datasets demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly reducing the annotation cost where it consistently outperforms other baselines.

        ## [1797] Two-Stream Networks for Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization with Semantic-Aware Mechanisms

        **Authors**: *Yu Wang, Yadong Li, Hongbin Wang*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01810](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01810)

        **Abstract**:

        Weakly-supervised temporal action localization aims to detect action boundaries in untrimmed videos with only video-level annotations. Most existing schemes detect tem-poral regions that are most responsive to video-level classification, but they overlook the semantic consistency between frames. In this paper, we hypothesize that snippets with similar representations should be considered as the same action class despite the absence of supervision signals on each snippet. To this end, we devise a learnable dictionary where entries are the class centroids of the corresponding action categories. The representations of snippets identified as the same action category are induced to be close to the same class centroid, which guides the network to perceive the semantics of frames and avoid unreasonable localization. Besides, we propose a two-stream framework that in-tegrates the attention mechanism and the multiple-instance learning strategy to extract fine-grained clues and salient features respectively. Their complementarity enables the model to refine temporal boundaries. Finally, the developed model is validated on the publicly available THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets, where substantial experiments and analyses demonstrate that our model achieves remark-able advances over existing methods.

        ## [1798] Weakly Supervised Video Emotion Detection and Prediction via Cross-Modal Temporal Erasing Network

        **Authors**: *Zhicheng Zhang, Lijuan Wang, Jufeng Yang*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01811](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01811)

        **Abstract**:

        Automatically predicting the emotions of user-generated videos (UGVs) receives increasing interest recently. However, existing methods mainly focus on a few key visual frames, which may limit their capacity to encode the context that depicts the intended emotions. To tackle that, in this paper, we propose a cross-modal temporal erasing network that locates not only keyframes but also context and audio-related information in a weakly-supervised manner. In specific, we first leverage the intra- and inter-modal relationship among different segments to accurately select keyframes. Then, we iteratively erase keyframes to encourage the model to concentrate on the contexts that include complementary information. Extensive experiments on three challenging video emotion benchmarks demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches. The code is released on https://github.com/nku-zhichengzhang/WECL.

        ## [1799] Collaborative Noisy Label Cleaner: Learning Scene-aware Trailers for Multi-modal Highlight Detection in Movies

        **Authors**: *Bei Gan, Xiujun Shu, Ruizhi Qiao, Haoqian Wu, Keyu Chen, Hanjun Li, Bo Ren*

        **Conference**: *cvpr 2023*

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01812](https://doi.org/10.1109/CVPR52729.2023.01812)

        **Abstract**:

        Movie highlights stand out of the screenplay for efficient browsing and play a crucial role on social media platforms. Based on existing efforts, this work has two observations: (1) For different annotators, labeling highlight has uncertainty, which leads to inaccurate and time-consuming annotations. (2) Besides previous supervised or unsupervised settings, some existing video corpora can be useful, e.g., trailers, but they are often noisy and incomplete to cover the full highlights. In this work, we study a more practical and promising setting, i.e., reformulating high-light detection as ‚Äúlearning with noisy labels‚Äù. This setting does not require time-consuming manual annotations and can fully utilize existing abundant video corpora. First, based on movie trailers, we leverage scene segmentation to obtain complete shots, which are regarded as noisy labels. Then, we propose a Collaborative noisy Label Cleaner (CLC) framework to learn from noisy highlight moments. CLC consists of two modules: augmented cross-propagation (ACP) and multimodality cleaning (MMC). The former aims to exploit the closely related audio-visual signals and fuse them to learn unified multimodal representations. The latter aims to achieve cleaner highlight labels by observing the changes in losses among different modalities. To verify the effectiveness of CLC, we further collect a large-scale highlight dataset named MovieLights. Comprehensive experiments on MovieLights and YouTube Highlights datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code has been made available at: https://github.com/TencentYoutuResearch/HighlightDetection-CLC.
