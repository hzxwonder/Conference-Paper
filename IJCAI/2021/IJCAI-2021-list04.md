**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/601](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/601)

**Abstract**:

Much of the focus on explanation in the field of artificial intelligence has focused on machine learning methods and, in particular, concepts produced by advanced methods such as neural networks and deep learning. However, there has been a long history of explanation generation in the general field of constraint satisfaction, one of the AI's most ubiquitous subfields. In this paper we survey the major seminal papers on the explanation and constraints, as well as some more recent works. The survey sets out to unify many disparate lines of work in areas such as model-based diagnosis, constraint programming, Boolean satisfiability, truth maintenance systems, quantified logics, and related areas.

**Authors**: *Xuhui Fan, Bin Li, Ling Luo, Scott A. Sisson*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/602](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/602)

**Abstract**:

Bayesian nonparametric space partition (BNSP) models provide a variety of strategies for partitioning a D-dimensional space into a set of blocks, such that
the data within the same block share certain kinds of homogeneity. BNSP models are applicable to many areas, including regression/classification trees, random feature construction, and relational modelling. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this subject.
We explore the current progress of BNSP research through  three perspectives: (1) Partition strategies, where we review the various techniques for generating partitions and discuss their theoretical foundation, `self-consistency'; (2) Applications, where we detail the current mainstream usages of BNSP models and identify some potential future applications; and (3) Challenges, where we discuss current unsolved problems and possible avenues for future research.

## [602] Where Is Your Place, Visual Place Recognition?

**Authors**: *Sourav Garg, Tobias Fischer, Michael Milford*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/603](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/603)

**Abstract**:

Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is often characterized as being able to recognize the same place despite significant changes in appearance and viewpoint. VPR is a key component of Spatial Artificial Intelligence, enabling robotic platforms and intelligent augmentation platforms such as augmented reality devices to perceive and understand the physical world. In this paper, we observe that there are three "drivers" that impose requirements on spatially intelligent agents and thus VPR systems: 1) the particular agent including its sensors and computational resources, 2) the operating environment of this agent, and 3) the specific task that the artificial agent carries out. In this paper, we characterize and survey key works in the VPR area considering those drivers, including their place representation and place matching choices. We also provide a new definition of VPR based on the visual overlap - akin to spatial view cells in the brain - that enables us to find similarities and differences to other research areas in the robotics and computer vision fields. We identify several open challenges and suggest areas that require more in-depth attention in future works.

## [603] A Comprehensive Survey on Image Dehazing Based on Deep Learning

**Authors**: *Jie Gui, Xiaofeng Cong, Yuan Cao, Wenqi Ren, Jun Zhang, Jing Zhang, Dacheng Tao*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/604](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/604)

**Abstract**:

The presence of haze significantly reduces the quality of images. Researchers have designed a variety of algorithms for image dehazing (ID) to restore the quality of hazy images. However, there are few studies that summarize the deep learning (DL) based dehazing technologies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the recent proposed dehazing methods. Firstly, we conclude the commonly used datasets, loss functions and evaluation metrics. Secondly, we group the existing researches of ID into two major categories: supervised ID and unsupervised ID. The core ideas of various influential dehazing models are introduced. Finally, the open issues for future research on ID are pointed out.

## [604] Emerging Methods of Auction Design in Social Networks

**Authors**: *Yuhang Guo, Dong Hao*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/605](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/605)

**Abstract**:

In recent years, a new branch of auction models called diffusion auction has extended the traditional auction into social network scenarios. The diffusion auction models the auction as a networked market whose nodes are potential customers and whose edges are the relations between these customers. The diffusion auction mechanism can incentivize buyers to not only submit a truthful bid, but also further invite their surrounding neighbors to participate into the auction. It can convene more participants than traditional auction mechanisms, which leads to better optimizations of different key aspects, such as social welfare, sellerâ€™s revenue, amount of redistributed money and so on. The diffusion auctions have recently attracted a discrete interest in the algorithmic game theory and market design communities. This survey summarizes the current progress of diffusion auctions.

## [605] Recent Advances in Heterogeneous Relation Learning for Recommendation

**Authors**: *Chao Huang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/606](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/606)

**Abstract**:

Recommender systems have played a critical role in many web applications to meet user's personalized interests and alleviate the information overload. In this survey, we review the development of recommendation frameworks with the focus on heterogeneous relational learning, which consists of different types of dependencies among users and items. The objective of this task is to map heterogeneous relational data into latent representation space, such that the structural and relational properties from both user and item domain can be well preserved. To address this problem, recent research developments can fall into three major categories: social recommendation, knowledge graph-enhanced recommender system, and multi-behavior recommendation. We discuss the learning approaches in each category, such as matrix factorization, attention mechanism and graph neural networks, for effectively distilling heterogeneous contextual information. Finally, we present exploratory outlook to highlight several promising directions and opportunities in heterogeneous relational learning frameworks for recommendation.

**Authors**: *Viet Huynh, Dinh Q. Phung, He Zhao*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/607](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/607)

**Abstract**:

Optimal transport has a long history in mathematics which was proposed by Gaspard Monge in the eighteenth century (Monge, 1781). However, until recently, advances in optimal transport theory pave the way for its use in the AI community, particularly for formulating deep generative models. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the literature in the field of deep generative models using optimal transport theory with an aim of providing a systematic review as well as outstanding problems and more importantly, open research opportunities to use the tools from the established optimal transport theory in the deep generative model domain.

## [607] Reasoning-Based Learning of Interpretable ML Models

**Authors**: *Alexey Ignatiev, João Marques-Silva, Nina Narodytska, Peter J. Stuckey*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/608](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/608)

**Abstract**:

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used in decision making procedures in myriads of real-world applications across important practical areas such as finance, healthcare, education, and safety critical systems. Due to its ubiquitous use in safety and privacy critical domains, it is often vital to understand the reasoning behind the AI decisions, which motivates the need for explainable AI (XAI). One of the major approaches to XAI is represented by computing so-called interpretable machine learning (ML) models, such as decision trees (DT), decision lists (DL) and decision sets (DS). These models build on the use of if-then rules and are thus deemed to be easily understandable by humans. A number of approaches have been proposed in the recent past to devising all kinds of interpretable ML models, the most prominent of which involve encoding the problem into a logic formalism, which is then tackled by invoking a reasoning or discrete optimization procedure. This paper overviews the recent advances of the reasoning and constraints based approaches to learning interpretable ML models and discusses their advantages and limitations.

## [608] If Only We Had Better Counterfactual Explanations: Five Key Deficits to Rectify in the Evaluation of Counterfactual XAI Techniques

**Authors**: *Mark T. Keane, Eoin M. Kenny, Eoin Delaney, Barry Smyth*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/609](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/609)

**Abstract**:

In recent years, there has been an explosion of AI research on counterfactual explanations as a solution to the problem of eXplainable AI (XAI).  These explanations seem to offer technical, psychological and legal benefits over other explanation techniques. We survey 100 distinct counterfactual explanation methods reported in the literature. This survey addresses the extent to which these methods have been adequately evaluated, both psychologically and computationally, and quantifies the shortfalls occurring. For instance, only 21% of these methods have been user tested. Five key deficits in the evaluation of these methods are detailed and a roadmap, with standardised benchmark evaluations, is proposed to resolve the issues arising; issues, that currently effectively block scientific progress in this field.

**Authors**: *Yunshi Lan, Gaole He, Jinhao Jiang, Jing Jiang, Wayne Xin Zhao, Ji-Rong Wen*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/611](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/611)

**Abstract**:

Knowledge base question answering (KBQA) aims to answer a question over a knowledge base (KB). Recently, a large number of studies focus on semantically or syntactically complicated questions. In this paper, we elaborately summarize the typical challenges and solutions for complex KBQA.  We begin with introducing the background about the KBQA task.  Next, we present the two mainstream categories of methods for complex KBQA, namely semantic parsing-based (SP-based) methods and information retrieval-based (IR-based) methods. We then review the advanced methods comprehensively from the perspective of the two categories. Specifically, we explicate their solutions to the typical challenges. Finally, we conclude and discuss some promising directions for future research.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/612](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/612)

**Abstract**:

Text generation has become one of the most important yet challenging tasks in natural language processing (NLP). The resurgence of deep learning
has greatly advanced this field by neural generation models, especially the paradigm of pretrained language models (PLMs). In this paper, we present
an overview of the major advances achieved in the topic of PLMs for text generation. As the preliminaries, we present the general task definition
and briefly describe the mainstream architectures of PLMs for text generation. As the core content, we discuss how to adapt existing PLMs to model
different input data and satisfy special properties in the generated text. We further summarize several important fine-tuning strategies for text generation. 
Finally, we present several future directions and conclude this paper. Our survey aims to provide text generation researchers a synthesis and pointer to related research.

## [612] Person Search Challenges and Solutions: A Survey

**Authors**: *Xiangtan Lin, Pengzhen Ren, Yun Xiao, Xiaojun Chang, Alex Hauptmann*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/613](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/613)

**Abstract**:

Person search has drawn increasing attention due to its real-world applications and research significance. Person search aims to find a probe person in a gallery of scene images with a wide range of applications, such as criminals search, multicamera tracking, missing person search, etc. Early person search works focused on image-based person search, which uses person image as the search query. Text-based person search is another major person search category that uses free-form natural language as the search query. Person search is challenging, and corresponding solutions are diverse and complex. Therefore, systematic surveys on this topic are essential. This paper surveyed the recent works on image-based and text-based person search from the perspective of challenges and solutions. Specifically, we provide a brief analysis of highly influential person search methods considering the three significant challenges: the discriminative person features, the query-person gap, and the detection-identification inconsistency. We summarise and compare evaluation results. Finally, we discuss open issues and some promising future research directions.

## [613] Policy Learning with Constraints in Model-free Reinforcement Learning: A Survey

**Authors**: *Yongshuai Liu, Avishai Halev, Xin Liu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/614](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/614)

**Abstract**:

Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have had tremendous success in simulated domains. These algorithms, however, often cannot be directly applied to physical systems, especially in cases where there are constraints to satisfy (e.g. to ensure safety or limit resource consumption). In standard RL, the agent is incentivized to explore any policy with the sole goal of maximizing reward; in the real world, however, ensuring satisfaction of certain constraints in the process is also necessary and essential. In this article, we overview existing approaches addressing constraints in model-free reinforcement learning. We model the problem of learning with constraints as a Constrained Markov Decision Process and consider two main types of constraints: cumulative and instantaneous. We summarize existing approaches and discuss their pros and cons. To evaluate policy performance under constraints, we introduce a set of standard benchmarks and metrics. We also summarize limitations of current methods and present open questions for future research.

## [614] What's the Context? Implicit and Explicit Assumptions in Model-Based Goal Recognition

**Authors**: *Peta Masters, Mor Vered*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/615](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/615)

**Abstract**:

Every model involves assumptions. While some are standard to all models that simulate intelligent decision-making (e.g., discrete/continuous, static/dynamic), goal recognition is well known also to involve choices about the observed agent: is it aware of being observed? cooperative or adversarial? In this paper, we examine not only these but the many other assumptions made in the context of model-based goal recognition. By exploring their meaning, the relationships between them and the confusions that can arise, we demonstrate their importance, shed light on the way trends emerge in AI, and suggest a novel means for researchers to uncover suitable avenues for future work.

## [615] A Survey on Goal Recognition as Planning

**Authors**: *Felipe Meneguzzi, Ramon Fraga Pereira*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/616](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/616)

**Abstract**:

Goal Recognition is the task of inferring an agent's goal, from a set of hypotheses, given a model of the environment dynamic, and a sequence of observations of such agent's behavior. While research on this problem gathered momentum as an offshoot of plan recognition, recent research has established it as a major subject of research on its own, leading to numerous new approaches that both expand the expressivity of domains in which to perform goal recognition and substantial advances to the state-of-the-art on established domain types. In this survey, we focus on the advances to goal recognition achieved in the last decade, categorizing the resulting techniques and identifying a number of opportunities for further breakthrough research.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/617](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/617)

**Abstract**:

Real  world  decision  making  problems  often  involve  both  discrete  and  continuous  variables  and require  a  combination  of  probabilistic  and  deterministic  knowledge. Stimulated  by  recent  advances  in  automated  reasoning  technology,   hybrid  (discrete+continuous)  probabilistic  reasoning with  constraints  has  emerged  as  a  lively  and  fast growing  research  field.   In  this  paper  we  provide a  survey  of  existing  techniques  for  hybrid  probabilistic  inference  with  logic  and  algebraic  constraints.   We leverage weighted model integration as  a  unifying  formalism  and  discuss  the  different paradigms that have been used as well as the expressivity-efficiency trade-offs that have been investigated. We conclude the survey with a comparative  overview  of  existing  implementations  and  a critical discussion of open challenges and promising research directions.

In recent years, algorithms and neural architectures based on the Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm, a well-known heuristic for the graph isomorphism problem, emerged as a powerful tool for (supervised) machine learning with graphs and relational data. Here, we give a comprehensive overview of the algorithm's use in a machine learning setting. We discuss the theoretical background, show how to use it for supervised graph- and node classification, discuss recent extensions, and its connection to neural architectures. Moreover, we give an overview of current applications and future directions to stimulate research.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/619](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/619)

**Abstract**:

The reporting and the analysis of current events around the globe has expanded from professional, editor-lead journalism all the way to citizen journalism. Nowadays, politicians and other key players enjoy direct access to their audiences through social media, bypassing the filters of official cables or traditional media. However, the multiple advantages of free speech and direct communication are dimmed by the misuse of media to spread inaccurate or misleading claims. These phenomena have led to the modern incarnation of the fact-checker --- a professional whose main aim is to examine claims using available evidence and to assess their veracity. Here, we survey the available intelligent technologies that can support the human expert in the different steps of her fact-checking endeavor. These include identifying claims worth fact-checking, detecting relevant previously fact-checked claims, retrieving relevant evidence to fact-check a claim, and actually verifying a claim. In each case, we pay attention to the challenges and the potential impact on real-world fact-checking.

## [619] Ten Years of BabelNet: A Survey

**Authors**: *Roberto Navigli, Michele Bevilacqua, Simone Conia, Dario Montagnini, Francesco Cecconi*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/620](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/620)

**Abstract**:

The intelligent manipulation of symbolic knowledge has been a long-sought goal of AI. However, when it comes to Natural Language Processing (NLP), symbols have to be mapped to words and phrases, which are not only ambiguous but also language-specific: multilinguality is indeed a desirable property for NLP systems, and one which enables the generalization of tasks where multiple languages need to be dealt with, without translating text. In this paper we survey BabelNet, a popular wide-coverage lexical-semantic knowledge resource obtained by merging heterogeneous sources into a unified semantic network that helps to scale tasks and applications to hundreds of languages. Over its ten years of existence, thanks to its promise to interconnect languages and resources in structured form, BabelNet has been employed in countless ways and directions. We first introduce the BabelNet model, its components and statistics, and then overview its successful use in a wide range of tasks in NLP as well as in other fields of AI.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/621](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/621)

**Abstract**:

This paper presents a survey of researches in analogical reasoning whose building block are analogical proportions which are statements of the form “a is to b as c is to d”. They have been developed in the last twenty years within an Artificial Intelligence perspective. After discussing their formal modeling with the associated inference mechanism, the paper reports the main results obtained in various AI domains ranging from computational linguistics to classification, including image processing, I.Q. tests, case based reasoning, preference learning, and formal concepts analysis. The last section discusses some new theoretical concerns, and the potential of analogical proportions in other areas such as argumentation, transfer learning, and XAI.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/622](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/622)

**Abstract**:

Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) aims to extract the semantics frame of user queries, which is a core component in a task-oriented dialog system. With the burst of deep neural networks and the evolution of pre-trained language models, the research of SLU has obtained signiﬁcant breakthroughs. However, there remains a lack of a comprehensive survey summarizing existing approaches and recent trends, which motivated the work presented in this article. In this paper, we survey recent advances and new frontiers in SLU. Specifically, we give a thorough review of this research ﬁeld, covering different aspects including (1) new taxonomy: we provide a new perspective for SLU ﬁled, including single model vs. joint model, implicit joint modeling vs. explicit joint modeling in joint model, non pre-trained paradigm vs. pretrained paradigm; (2) new frontiers: some emerging areas in complex SLU as well as the corresponding challenges; (3) abundant open-source resources: to help the community, we have collected, organized the related papers, baseline projects and leaderboard on a public website where SLU researchers could directly access to the recent progress. We hope that this survey can shed a light on future research in SLU ﬁeld.

**Abstract**:

Temporal point processes (TPP) are probabilistic generative models for continuous-time event sequences. Neural TPPs combine the fundamental ideas from point process literature with deep learning approaches, thus enabling construction of flexible and efficient models. The topic of neural TPPs has attracted significant attention in the recent years, leading to the development of numerous new architectures and applications for this class of models. In this review paper we aim to consolidate the existing body of knowledge on neural TPPs. Specifically, we focus on important design choices and general principles for defining neural TPP models. Next, we provide an overview of application areas commonly considered in the literature. We conclude this survey with the list of open challenges and important directions for future work in the field of neural TPPs.

## [624] A Unifying Bayesian Formulation of Measures of Interpretability in Human-AI Interaction

**Authors**: *Sarath Sreedharan, Anagha Kulkarni, David E. Smith, Subbarao Kambhampati*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/625](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/625)

**Abstract**:

Existing approaches for generating human-aware agent behaviors have considered different measures of interpretability in isolation. Further, these measures have been studied under differing assumptions, thus precluding the possibility of designing a single framework that captures these measures under the same assumptions.
In this paper, we present a unifying Bayesian framework that models a human observer's evolving beliefs about an agent and thereby define the problem of Generalized Human-Aware Planning. We will show that the definitions of interpretability measures like explicability, legibility and predictability from the prior literature fall out as special cases of our general framework. Through this framework, we also bring a previously ignored fact to light that the human-robot interactions are in effect open-world problems, particularly as a result of modeling the human's beliefs over the agent. Since the human may not only hold beliefs unknown to the agent but may also form new hypotheses about the agent when presented with novel or unexpected behaviors.

## [626] A Survey on Response Selection for Retrieval-based Dialogues

**Authors**: *Chongyang Tao, Jiazhan Feng, Rui Yan, Wei Wu, Daxin Jiang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/627](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/627)

**Abstract**:

Building an intelligent dialogue system capable of naturally and coherently conversing with humans has been a long-standing goal of artificial intelligence.  In the past decade, with the development of machine/deep learning technology and the explosive growth of available conversation data in social media, numerous neural models have been developed for context-response matching tasks in retrieval-based dialogue systems, with more fluent and informative responses compared with generative models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in response selection for retrieval-based dialogues. In particular, we first formulate the problem of response selection and review state-of-the-art context-response matching models categorized by their architecture. 
Then we summarize some recent advances on the research of response selection, including incorporation with extra knowledge and exploration on more effective model learning. Finally, we highlight the challenges which are not yet well addressed in this task and present future research directions.

## [627] Generalizing to Unseen Domains: A Survey on Domain Generalization

**Authors**: *Jindong Wang, Cuiling Lan, Chang Liu, Yidong Ouyang, Tao Qin*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/628](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/628)

**Abstract**:

Domain generalization (DG), i.e., out-of-distribution generalization, has attracted increased interests in recent years. Domain generalization deals with a challenging setting where one or several different but related domain(s) are given, and the goal is to learn a model that can generalize to an unseen test domain. For years, great progress has been achieved. This paper presents the first review for recent advances in domain generalization. First, we provide a formal definition of domain generalization and discuss several related fields. Then, we categorize recent algorithms into three classes and present them in detail: data manipulation, representation learning, and learning strategy, each of which contains several popular algorithms. Third, we introduce the commonly used datasets and applications. Finally, we summarize existing literature and present some potential research topics for the future.

**Authors**: *Rui Wang, Xu Tan, Renqian Luo, Tao Qin, Tie-Yan Liu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/629](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/629)

**Abstract**:

Neural approaches have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on machine translation but suffer from the high cost of collecting large scale parallel data. Thus, a lot of research has been conducted for neural machine translation (NMT) with very limited parallel data, i.e., the low-resource setting. In this paper, we provide a survey for low-resource NMT and classify related works into three categories according to the auxiliary data they used: (1) exploiting monolingual data of source and/or target languages, (2) exploiting data from auxiliary languages, and (3) exploiting multi-modal data. We hope that our survey can help researchers to better understand this field and inspire them to design better algorithms, and help industry practitioners to choose appropriate algorithms for their applications.

**Authors**: *Shoujin Wang, Liang Hu, Yan Wang, Xiangnan He, Quan Z. Sheng, Mehmet A. Orgun, Longbing Cao, Francesco Ricci, Philip S. Yu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/630](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/630)

**Abstract**:

Recent years have witnessed the fast development of the emerging topic of Graph Learning based Recommender Systems (GLRS). GLRS mainly employ advanced graph learning approaches to model users’ preferences and intentions as well as items’ characteristics and popularity for Recommender Systems (RS). Differently from other approaches, including content based filtering and collaborative filtering, GLRS are built on graphs where the important objects, e.g., users, items, and attributes, are either explicitly or implicitly connected. With the rapid development of graph learning techniques, exploring and exploiting homogeneous or heterogeneous relations in graphs is a promising direction for building more effective RS. In this paper, we provide a systematic review of GLRS, by discussing how they extract knowledge from graphs to improve the accuracy, reliability and explainability of the recommendations. First, we characterize and formalize GLRS, and then summarize and categorize the key challenges and main progress in this novel research area.

## [630] Time Series Data Augmentation for Deep Learning: A Survey

**Authors**: *Qingsong Wen, Liang Sun, Fan Yang, Xiaomin Song, Jingkun Gao, Xue Wang, Huan Xu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/631](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/631)

**Abstract**:

Deep learning performs remarkably well on many time series analysis tasks recently. The superior performance of deep neural networks relies heavily on a large number of training data to avoid overfitting. However, the labeled data of many real-world time series applications may be limited such as classification in medical time series and anomaly detection in AIOps. As an effective way to enhance the size and quality of the training data, data augmentation is crucial to the successful application of deep learning models on time series data. In this paper, we systematically review different data augmentation methods for time series. We propose a taxonomy for the reviewed methods, and then provide a structured review for these methods by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also empirically compare different data augmentation methods for different tasks including time series classification, anomaly detection, and forecasting. Finally, we discuss and highlight five future directions to provide useful research guidance.

## [631] Challenges and Opportunities of Building Fast GBDT Systems

**Authors**: *Zeyi Wen, Qinbin Li, Bingsheng He, Bin Cui*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/632](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/632)

**Abstract**:

In the last few years, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDTs) have been widely used in various applications such as online advertising and spam filtering. However, GBDT training is often a key performance bottleneck for such data science pipelines, especially for training a large number of deep trees on large data sets. Thus, many parallel and distributed GBDT systems have been researched and developed to accelerate the training process. In this survey paper, we review the recent GBDT systems with respect to accelerations with emerging hardware as well as cluster computing, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of the existing implementations. Finally, we present the research opportunities and challenges in designing fast next generation GBDT systems.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/633](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/633)

**Abstract**:

We present a review on the recent advances and emerging opportunities around the theme of analyzing deep neural networks (DNNs) with information-theoretic methods. We first discuss popular information-theoretic quantities and their estimators. We then introduce recent developments on information-theoretic learning principles (e.g., loss functions, regularizers and objectives) and their parameterization with DNNs. We finally briefly review current usages of information-theoretic concepts in a few modern machine learning problems and list a few emerging opportunities.

## [633] A Comparative Survey: Benchmarking for Pool-based Active Learning

**Authors**: *Xueying Zhan, Huan Liu, Qing Li, Antoni B. Chan*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/634](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/634)

**Abstract**:

Active learning (AL) is a subfield of machine learning (ML) in which a learning algorithm aims to achieve good accuracy with fewer training samples by interactively querying the oracles to label new data points. Pool-based AL is well-motivated in many ML tasks, where unlabeled data is abundant, but their labels are hard or costly to obtain. Although many pool-based AL methods have been developed, some important questions remain unanswered such as how to: 1) determine the current state-of-the-art technique; 2) evaluate the relative benefit of new methods for various properties of the dataset; 3) understand what specific problems merit greater attention; and 4) measure the progress of the field over time. In this paper, we survey and compare various AL strategies used in both recently proposed and classic highly-cited methods. We propose to benchmark pool-based AL methods with a variety of datasets and quantitative metric, and draw insights from the comparative empirical results.

## [634] A Survey on Universal Adversarial Attack

**Authors**: *Chaoning Zhang, Philipp Benz, Chenguo Lin, Adil Karjauv, Jing Wu, In So Kweon*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/635](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/635)

**Abstract**:

The intriguing phenomenon of adversarial examples has attracted significant attention in machine learning and what might be more surprising to the community is the existence of universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), i.e. a single perturbation to fool the target DNN for most images. With the focus on UAP against deep classifiers, this survey summarizes the recent progress on universal adversarial attacks, discussing the challenges from both the attack and defense sides, as well as the reason for the existence of UAP. We aim to extend this work as a dynamic survey that will regularly update its content to follow new works regarding UAP or universal attack in a wide range of domains, such as image, audio, video, text, etc. Relevant updates will be discussed at: https://bit.ly/2SbQlLG. We welcome authors of future works in this field to contact us for including your new findings.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/636](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/636)

**Abstract**:

Click-through rate (CTR) estimation plays as a core function module in various personalized online services, including online advertising, recommender systems, and web search etc. From 2015, the success of deep learning started to benefit CTR estimation performance and now deep CTR models have been widely applied in many industrial platforms. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of deep learning models for CTR estimation tasks. First, we take a review of the transfer from shallow to deep CTR models and explain why going deep is a necessary trend of development. Second, we concentrate on explicit feature interaction learning modules of deep CTR models. Then, as an important perspective on large platforms with abundant user histories, deep behavior models are discussed. Moreover, the recently emerged automated methods for deep CTR architecture design are presented. Finally, we summarize the survey and discuss the future prospects of this field.

## [636] Automated Machine Learning on Graphs: A Survey

**Authors**: *Ziwei Zhang, Xin Wang, Wenwu Zhu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/637](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/637)

**Abstract**:

Machine learning on graphs has been extensively studied	in both academic and industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different graph-related tasks. To solve this critical challenge, automated machine learning (AutoML) on graphs which combines the strength of graph machine learning and AutoML together, is gaining attention from the research community. Therefore, we comprehensively survey AutoML on graphs in this paper, primarily focusing on hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for graph machine learning. We further overview libraries related to automated graph machine learning and in-depth discuss AutoGL, the first dedicated open-source library for AutoML on graphs. In the end, we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine learning. This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive review of automated machine learning on graphs to the best of our knowledge.

## [637] Topic Modelling Meets Deep Neural Networks: A Survey

**Authors**: *He Zhao, Dinh Q. Phung, Viet Huynh, Yuan Jin, Lan Du, Wray L. Buntine*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/638](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/638)

**Abstract**:

Topic modelling has been a successful technique for text analysis for almost twenty years. When topic modelling met deep neural networks, there emerged a new and increasingly popular research area, neural topic models, with nearly a hundred models developed and a wide range of applications in neural language understanding such as text generation, summarisation and language models. There is a need to summarise research developments and discuss open problems and future directions. In this paper, we provide a focused yet comprehensive overview of neural topic models for interested researchers in the AI community, so as to facilitate them to navigate and innovate in this fast-growing research area. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first review on this specific topic.

## [638] Cross-Domain Recommendation: Challenges, Progress, and Prospects

**Authors**: *Feng Zhu, Yan Wang, Chaochao Chen, Jun Zhou, Longfei Li, Guanfeng Liu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/639](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/639)

**Abstract**:

To address the long-standing data sparsity problem in recommender systems (RSs), cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proposed to leverage the relatively richer information from a richer domain to improve the recommendation performance in a sparser domain. Although CDR has been extensively studied in recent years, there is a lack of a systematic review of the existing CDR approaches. To fill this gap, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of existing CDR approaches, including challenges, research progress, and prospects. Specifically, we first summarize existing CDR approaches into four types, including single-target CDR, single-target multi-domain recommendation (MDR), dual-target CDR, and multi-target CDR. We then present the definitions and challenges of these CDR approaches. Next, we propose a full-view categorization and new taxonomies on these approaches and report their research progress in detail. In the end, we share several promising prospects in CDR.

## [639] Hierarchical Graph Traversal for Aggregate k Nearest Neighbors Search in Road Networks (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Tenindra Abeywickrama, Muhammad Aamir Cheema, Sabine Storandt*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/640](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/640)

**Abstract**:

A k nearest neighbors (kNN) query finds k closest points-of-interest (POIs) from an agent's location. In this paper, we study a natural extension of the kNN query for multiple agents, namely, the Aggregate k Nearest Neighbors (AkNN) query.  An AkNN query retrieves k POIs with the smallest aggregate distances where the aggregate distance of a POI is obtained by aggregating its distances from the multiple agents (e.g., sum of its distances from each agent). We propose a novel data structure COLT (Compacted Object-Landmark Tree) which enables efficient hierarchical graph traversal and utilize it to efficiently answer AkNN queries. Our experiments on real-world and synthetic data sets show that our techniques outperform existing approaches by more than an order of magnitude in almost all settings.

## [640] Defining the Semantics of Abstract Argumentation Frameworks through Logic Programs and Partial Stable Models (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Gianvincenzo Alfano, Sergio Greco, Francesco Parisi, Irina Trubitsyna*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/641](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/641)

**Abstract**:

Extensions of Dungâ€™s Argumentation Framework (AF) include the class of Recursive Bipolar AFs (Rec-BAFs), i.e. AFs with recursive attacks and supports. We show that a Rec-BAF \Delta can be translated into a logic program P_\Delta so that the extensions of \Delta under different semantics coincide with subsets of the partial stable models of P_\Delta.

## [641] Comparing Weak Admissibility Semantics to their Dung-style Counterparts (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Ringo Baumann, Gerhard Brewka, Markus Ulbricht*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/642](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/642)

**Abstract**:

Semantics based on weak admissibility were recently introduced to overcome a problem with self-defeating arguments that has not been solved for more than 25 years. The recursive definition of weak admissibility mainly relies on the notion of a reduct regarding a set E which only contains arguments which are neither in E, nor attacked by E. At first glance the reduct seems to be tailored for the weaker versions of Dung-style semantics only. In this paper we show that standard Dung semantics can be naturally reformulated using the reduct revealing that this concept is already implicit. We further identify a new abstract principle for semantics, so-called modularization describing how to obtain further extensions given an initial one. Its importance for the study of abstract argumentation semantics is shown by its ability to alternatively characterize classical and non-classical semantics.

## [642] Abstract Cores in Implicit Hitting Set MaxSat Solving (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Jeremias Berg, Fahiem Bacchus, Alex Poole*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/643](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/643)

**Abstract**:

Maximum satisfiability (MaxSat) solving  is an active area of research motivated by numerous successful applications to solving
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.  One of the most successful approaches for solving MaxSat instances from real world domains 
are the so called  implicit hitting set (IHS) solvers. IHS solvers decouple MaxSat solving into separate core-extraction (i.e. reasoning) and optimization steps which are tackled by a Boolean satisfiability (SAT)  and an integer linear programming (IP) solver, respectively. While the approach shows state-of-the-art performance on many industrial instances, 
it is known that there exists instances on which IHS solvers need to extract an exponential number of cores before terminating. Motivated by the simplest of these problematic instances, we propose abstract cores,  a compact representation for a potentially exponential number of regular cores. We demonstrate how to incorporate abstract core reasoning into the IHS algorithm and report on an empirical evaluation demonstrating, that including abstract cores into a state-of-the-art IHS solver improves its performance enough to surpass the best performing solvers of the 2019 MaxSat Evaluation.

## [643] Robust Domain Adaptation: Representations, Weights and Inductive Bias (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Victor Bouvier, Philippe Very, Clément Chastagnol, Myriam Tami, Céline Hudelot*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/644](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/644)

**Abstract**:

Domain Invariant Representations (IR) has improved drastically the transferability of representations from a labelled source domain to a new and unlabelled target domain. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in presence of label shift remains an open problem. To this purpose, we present a bound of the target risk which incorporates both weights and invariant representations. Our theoretical analysis highlights the role of inductive bias in aligning distributions across domains. We illustrate it on standard benchmarks by proposing a new learning procedure for UDA. We observed empirically that weak inductive bias makes adaptation robust to label shift. The elaboration of stronger inductive bias is a promising direction for new UDA algorithms.

## [644] Decentralized No-regret Learning Algorithms for Extensive-form Correlated Equilibria (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Andrea Celli, Alberto Marchesi, Gabriele Farina, Nicola Gatti*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/645](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/645)

**Abstract**:

The existence of uncoupled no-regret learning dynamics  converging to correlated equilibria in normal-form games is a celebrated result in the theory of multi-agent systems. Specifically, it has been known for more than 20 years that when all players seek to minimize their internal regret in a repeated normal-form game, the empirical frequency of play converges to a normal-form correlated equilibrium. Extensive-form games generalize normal-form games by modeling both sequential and simultaneous moves, as well as imperfect information. Because of the sequential nature and the presence of private information, correlation in extensive-form games possesses significantly different properties than in normal-form games. The extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) is the natural extensive-form counterpart to the classical notion of correlated equilibrium in normal-form games. Compared to the latter, the constraints that define the set of EFCEs are significantly more complex, as the correlation device ({\em a.k.a.} mediator) must take into account the evolution of beliefs of each player as they make observations throughout the game. Due to this additional complexity, the existence of uncoupled learning dynamics leading to an EFCE has remained a challenging open research question for a long time. In this article, we settle that question by giving the first uncoupled no-regret dynamics which provably converge to the set of EFCEs in n-player general-sum extensive-form games with perfect recall. We show that each iterate can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the game tree, and that, when all players play repeatedly according to our learning dynamics, the empirical frequency of play after T game repetitions is guaranteed to be a O(T^-1/2)-approximate EFCE with high probability, and an EFCE almost surely in the limit.

## [645] Weaving a Semantic Web of Credibility Reviews for Explainable Misinformation Detection (Extended Abstract)

**Abstract**:

This paper summarises work where we combined semantic web technologies with deep learning systems to obtain state-of-the art explainable misinformation detection.  We proposed a conceptual and computational model to describe a wide range of misinformation detection systems based around the concepts of credibility and reviews. We described how Credibility Reviews (CRs) can be used to build networks of distributed bots that collaborate for misinformation detection which we evaluated by building a prototype based on publicly available datasets and deep learning models.

## [646] Improved Guarantees and a Multiple-descent Curve for Column Subset Selection and the Nystrom Method (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Michal Derezinski, Rajiv Khanna, Michael W. Mahoney*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/647](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/647)

**Abstract**:

The Column Subset Selection Problem (CSSP) and the Nystrom method are among the leading tools for constructing interpretable low-rank approximations of large datasets by selecting a small but representative set of features or instances. A fundamental question in this area is: what is the cost of this interpretability, i.e., how well can a data subset of size k compete with the best rank k approximation? We develop techniques which exploit spectral properties of the data matrix to obtain improved approximation guarantees which go beyond the standard worst-case analysis. Our approach leads to significantly better bounds for datasets with known rates of singular value decay, e.g., polynomial or exponential decay. Our analysis also reveals an intriguing phenomenon: the cost of interpretability as a function of k may exhibit multiple peaks and valleys, which we call a multiple-descent curve. A lower bound we establish shows that this behavior is not an artifact of our analysis, but rather it is an inherent property of the CSSP and Nystrom tasks. Finally, using the example of a radial basis function (RBF) kernel, we show that both our improved bounds and the multiple-descent curve can be observed on real datasets simply by varying the RBF parameter.

## [647] Mental Models of AI Agents in a Cooperative Game Setting (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Katy Ilonka Gero, Zahra Ashktorab, Casey Dugan, Qian Pan, James Johnson, Werner Geyer, Maria Ruiz, Sarah Miller, David R. Millen, Murray Campbell, Sadhana Kumaravel, Wei Zhang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/648](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/648)

**Abstract**:

As more and more forms of AI become prevalent, it becomes increasingly important to understand how people develop mental models of these systems. In this work we study people's mental models of an AI agent in a cooperative word guessing game. We run a study in which people play the game with an AI agent while ``thinking out loud''; through thematic analysis we identify features of the mental models developed by participants. In a large-scale study we have participants play the game with the AI agent online and use a post-game survey to probe their mental model. We find that those who win more often have better estimates of the AI agent's abilities. We present three components---global knowledge, local knowledge, and knowledge distribution---for modeling AI systems and propose that understanding the underlying technology is insufficient for developing appropriate conceptual models---analysis of behavior is also necessary.

## [648] Successor-Invariant First-Order Logic on Classes of Bounded Degree (Extended Abstract)

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/649](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/649)

**Abstract**:

We study the expressive power of successor-invariant first-order logic, which is an extension of first-order logic where the usage of a successor relation on the vertices of the graph is allowed, as long as the validity of formulas is independent on the choice of a particular successor.
We show that when the degree is bounded, successor-invariant first-order logic is no more expressive than first-order logic.

## [649] Deep Drone Acrobatics (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Elia Kaufmann, Antonio Loquercio, René Ranftl, Matthias Müller, Vladlen Koltun, Davide Scaramuzza*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/650](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/650)

**Abstract**:

Acrobatic flight with quadrotors is extremely challenging. Maneuvers such as the loop, matty flip, or barrel roll require high thrust and extreme angular accelerations that push the platform to its limits.  Human drone pilots require years of practice to safely master such maneuvers. Yet, a tiny mistake could make the platform lose control, and brutally crash. This short paper describes an approach to safely train acrobatic controllers in simulation and deploy them with no fine-tuning zero-shot transfer on physical quadrotors. The approach uses only onboard sensing and computation.

## [650] On Sampled Metrics for Item Recommendation (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Walid Krichene, Steffen Rendle*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/651](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/651)

**Abstract**:

Recommender systems personalize content by recommending items to users. Item recommendation algorithms are evaluated by metrics that compare the positions of truly relevant items among the recommended items. To speed up the computation of metrics, recent work often uses sampled metrics where only a smaller set of random items and the relevant items are ranked. This paper investigates such sampled metrics and shows that they are inconsistent with their exact counterpart, in the sense that they do not persist relative statements, e.g., recommender A is better than B, not even in expectation. We show that it is possible to improve the quality of the sampled metrics by applying a correction. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of the naive sampled metrics and their corrected variants. Our work suggests that sampling should be avoided for metric calculation, however if an experimental study needs to sample, the proposed corrections can improve the estimates.

## [651] Revisiting Wedge Sampling for Budgeted Maximum Inner Product Search (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Stephan Sloth Lorenzen, Ninh Pham*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/652](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/652)

**Abstract**:

Top-k maximum inner product search (MIPS) is a central task in many machine learning applications. This work extends top-k MIPS with a budgeted setting, that asks for the best approximate top-k MIPS given a limited budget of computational operations. We study recent advanced sampling methods, including wedge and diamond sampling, to solve budgeted top-k MIPS. First, we theoretically show that diamond sampling is essentially a combination of wedge sampling and basic sampling for top-k MIPS. Second, we propose dWedge, a simple deterministic variant of wedge sampling for budgeted top-k MIPS. Empirically, dWedge provides significantly higher accuracy than other budgeted top-k MIPS solvers while maintaining a similar speedup.

## [652] On Learning Sets of Symmetric Elements (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Haggai Maron, Or Litany, Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/653](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/653)

**Abstract**:

Learning from unordered sets is a fundamental learning setup, recently attracting increasing attention. Research in this area has focused on the case where elements of the set are represented by feature vectors, and far less emphasis has been given to the common case where set elements themselves adhere to their own symmetries. That case is relevant to numerous applications, from deblurring image bursts to multi-view 3D shape recognition and reconstruction. In this paper, we present a principled approach to learning sets of general symmetric elements. We first characterize the space of linear layers that are equivariant both to element reordering and to the inherent symmetries of elements, like translation in the case of images. We further show that networks that are composed of these layers, called Deep Sets for Symmetric Elements layers (DSS), are universal approximators of both invariant and equivariant functions, and that these networks are strictly more expressive than Siamese networks. DSS layers are also straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that they improve over existing set-learning architectures in a series of experiments with images, graphs, and point clouds.

## [653] The Moodoo Library: Quantitative Metrics to Model How Teachers Make Use of the Classroom Space by Analysing Indoor Positioning Traces (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Roberto Martínez Maldonado, Vanessa Echeverría, Katerina Mangaroska, Antonette Shibani, Gloria Fernández-Nieto, Jurgen Schulte, Simon Buckingham Shum*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/654](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/654)

**Abstract**:

Teachers’ spatial behaviours in the classroom can strongly influence students’ engagement, motivation and other behaviours that shape their learning. However, classroom teaching behav-iour is ephemeral, and has largely remained opaque to computational analysis. This paper presents a library called ‘Moodoo’  that can serve to automatically model how teachers make use of the classroom space by analysing indoor positioning traces. The system automatically ex-tracts spatial metrics (e.g. teacher-student ratios, frequency of visits to students’ personal spaces, presence in classroom spaces of interest, index of dispersion and entropy), mapping from the teachers’ low-level positioning data to higher-order spatial constructs.

## [654] Controlling Fairness and Bias in Dynamic Learning-to-Rank (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Marco Morik, Ashudeep Singh, Jessica Hong, Thorsten Joachims*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/655](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/655)

**Abstract**:

Rankings are the primary interface through which many online platforms match users to items (e.g. news, products, music, video). In these two-sided markets, not only do the users draw utility from the rankings, but the rankings also determine the utility (e.g. exposure, revenue) for the item providers (e.g. publishers, sellers, artists, studios). It has already been noted that myopically optimizing utility to the users -- as done by virtually all learning-to-rank algorithms -- can be unfair to the item providers. We, therefore, present a learning-to-rank approach for explicitly enforcing merit-based fairness guarantees to groups of items (e.g. articles by the same publisher, tracks by the same artist). In particular, we propose a learning algorithm that ensures notions of amortized group fairness, while simultaneously learning the ranking function from implicit feedback data. The algorithm takes the form of a controller that integrates unbiased estimators for both fairness and utility, dynamically adapting both as more data becomes available. In addition to its rigorous theoretical foundation and convergence guarantees, we find empirically that the algorithm is highly practical and robust.

## [655] Unifying Online and Counterfactual Learning to Rank: A Novel Counterfactual Estimator that Effectively Utilizes Online Interventions (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Harrie Oosterhuis, Maarten de Rijke*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/656](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/656)

**Abstract**:

State-of-the-art Learning to Rank (LTR) methods for optimizing ranking systems based on user interactions are divided into online approaches – that learn by direct interaction – and counterfactual approaches – that learn from historical interactions. We propose a novel intervention-aware estimator to bridge this online/counterfactual division. The estimator corrects for the effect of position bias, trust bias, and item-selection bias by using corrections based on the behavior of the logging policy and on online interventions: changes to the logging policy made during the gathering of click data. Our experimental results show that, unlike existing counterfactual LTR methods, the intervention-aware estimator can greatly benefit from online interventions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that is shown to be highly effective in both online and counterfactual scenarios.

## [656] Finding the Hardest Formulas for Resolution (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Tomás Peitl, Stefan Szeider*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/657](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/657)

**Abstract**:

A CNF formula is harder than another CNF formula with the same
number of clauses if it requires a longer resolution proof. We introduce
resolution hardness numbers; they give for m=1,2,... the length
of a shortest proof of a hardest formula on m clauses. We compute
the first ten resolution hardness numbers, along with the
corresponding hardest formulas.
To achieve this, we devise a candidate filtering and symmetry breaking
search scheme for limiting the number of potential candidates for hardest
formulas, and an efficient SAT encoding for computing a shortest
resolution proof of a given candidate formula.

## [657] Exploring the Effects of Goal Setting When Training for Complex Crowdsourcing Tasks (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Amy Rechkemmer, Ming Yin*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/658](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/658)

**Abstract**:

Training is one way of enabling novice workers to work on complex crowdsourcing tasks. Based on goal setting theory in psychology, we conduct a randomized experiment to study whether and how setting different goals---including performance goal, learning goal, and behavioral goal---when training workers for a complex crowdsourcing task affects workers' learning perception, learning gain, and post-training performance. We find that setting different goals during training significantly affects workers' learning perception, but does not have an effect on learning gain or post-training performance. Further, exploratory analysis helps shed light on when and why various goals may or may not work in the crowdsourcing context.

## [658] Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP Models with Checklist (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Marco Túlio Ribeiro, Tongshuang Wu, Carlos Guestrin, Sameer Singh*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/659](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/659)

**Abstract**:

Although measuring held-out accuracy has been the primary approach to evaluate generalization, it often overestimates the performance of NLP models, while alternative approaches for evaluating models either focus on individual tasks or on specific behaviors. Inspired by principles of behavioral testing in software engineering, we introduce CheckList, a task-agnostic methodology for testing NLP models. CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models. In a user study, a team responsible for a commercial sentiment analysis model found new and actionable bugs in an extensively tested model. In another user study, NLP practitioners with CheckList created twice as many tests, and found almost three times as many bugs as users without it.

## [659] Politeness for the Theory of Algebraic Datatypes (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Ying Sheng, Yoni Zohar, Christophe Ringeissen, Jane Lange, Pascal Fontaine, Clark W. Barrett*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/660](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/660)

**Abstract**:

Algebraic datatypes, and among them lists and trees, have attracted a lot of interest in automated reasoning and Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Since its latest stable version, the SMT-LIB standard defines a theory of algebraic datatypes, which is currently supported by several mainstream SMT solvers. In this paper, we study this particular theory of datatypes and prove that it is strongly polite, showing also how it can be combined with other arbitrary disjoint theories using polite combination. Our results cover both inductive and finite datatypes, as well as their union. The combination method uses a new, simple, and natural notion of additivity, that enables deducing strong politeness from (weak) politeness.

## [660] Imprecise Oracles Impose Limits to Predictability in Supervised Learning (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Anjali Sifar, Nisheeth Srivastava*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/661](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/661)

**Abstract**:

Supervised learning operates on the premise that labels unambiguously represent ground truth. This premise is reasonable in domains wherein a high degree of consensus is easily possible for any given data record, e.g. in agreeing on whether an image contains an elephant or not. However, there are several domains wherein people disagree with each other on the appropriate label to assign to a record, e.g. whether a tweet is toxic. We argue that data labeling must be understood as a process with some degree of domain-dependent noise and that any claims of predictive prowess must be sensitive to the degree of this noise. We present a method for quantifying labeling noise in a particular domain wherein people are seen to disagree with their own past selves on the appropriate label to assign to a record: choices under prospect uncertainty. Our results indicate that `state-of-the-art' choice models of decisions from description, by failing to consider the intrinsic variability of human choice behavior, find themselves in the odd position of predicting humans' choices better than the same humans' own previous choices for the same problem. We conclude with observations on how the predicament we empirically demonstrate in our work could be handled in the practice of supervised learning.

## [661] RAFT: Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms for Optical Flow (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Zachary Teed, Jia Deng*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/662](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/662)

**Abstract**:

We introduce Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (RAFT), a new deep network architecture for optical flow. RAFT extracts per-pixel features, builds multi-scale 4D correlation volumes for all pairs of pixels, and iteratively updates a flow field through a recurrent unit that performs lookups on the correlation volumes. RAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI and Sintel datasets. In addition, RAFT has strong cross-dataset generalization as well as high efficiency in inference time, training speed, and parameter count.

## [662] Open Intent Extraction from Natural Language Interactions (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Nikhita Vedula, Nedim Lipka, Pranav Maneriker, Srinivasan Parthasarathy*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/663](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/663)

**Abstract**:

Accurately discovering user intents from their written or spoken language plays a critical role in natural language understanding and automated dialog response. Most existing research models this as a classification task with a single intent label per utterance. Going beyond this formulation, we define and investigate a new problem of open intent discovery. It involves discovering one or more generic intent types from text utterances, that may not have been encountered during training. We propose a novel, domain-agnostic approach, OPINE, which formulates the problem as a sequence tagging task in an open-world setting. It employs a CRF on top of a bidirectional LSTM to extract intents in a consistent format, subject to constraints among intent tag labels. We apply multi-headed self-attention and adversarial training to effectively learn dependencies between distant words, and robustly adapt our model across varying domains. We also curate and release an intent-annotated dataset of 25K real-life utterances spanning diverse domains. Extensive experiments show that OPINE outperforms state-of-art baselines by 5-15% F1 score.

## [663] Speech Recognition Using RFID Tattoos (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Jingxian Wang, Chengfeng Pan, Haojian Jin, Vaibhav Singh, Yash Jain, Jason I. Hong, Carmel Majidi, Swarun Kumar*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/664](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/664)

**Abstract**:

This paper presents a radio-frequency (RF) based assistive technology for voice impairments (i.e., dysphonia), which occurs in an estimated 1% of the global population. We specifically focus on acquired voice disorders where users continue to be able to make facial and lip gestures associated with speech. Despite the rich literature on assistive technologies in this space, there remains a gap for a solution that neither requires external infrastructure in the environment, battery-powered sensors on skin or body-worn manual input devices. We present RFTattoo, which to our knowledge is the first wireless speech recognition system for voice impairments using batteryless and flexible RFID tattoos. We design specialized wafer-thin tattoos attached around the user's face and easily hidden by makeup. We build models that process signal variations from these tattoos to a portable RFID reader to recognize various facial gestures corresponding to distinct classes of sounds. We then develop natural language processing models that infer meaningful words and sentences based on the observed series of gestures. A detailed user study with 10 users reveals 86% accuracy in reconstructing the top-100 words in the English language, even without the users making any sounds.

## [664] Unsupervised Learning of Probably Symmetric Deformable 3D Objects from Images in the Wild (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Shangzhe Wu, Christian Rupprecht, Andrea Vedaldi*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/665](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/665)

**Abstract**:

We propose a method to learn 3D deformable object categories from raw single-view images, without external supervision. The method is based on an autoencoder that factors each input image into depth, albedo, viewpoint and illumination. In order to disentangle these components without supervision, we use the fact that many object categories have, at least approximately, a symmetric structure. We show that reasoning about illumination allows us to exploit the underlying object symmetry even if the appearance is not symmetric due to shading. Furthermore, we model objects that are probably, but not certainly, symmetric by predicting a symmetry probability map, learned end-to-end with the other components of the model. Our experiments show that this method can recover very accurately the 3D shape of human faces, cat faces and cars from single-view images, without any supervision or a prior shape model.

## [665] TAXOGAN: Hierarchical Network Representation Learning via Taxonomy Guided Generative Adversarial Networks (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Carl Yang, Jieyu Zhang, Jiawei Han*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/666](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/666)

**Abstract**:

Network representation learning aims at transferring node proximity in networks into distributed vectors, which can be leveraged in various downstream applications. Recent research has shown that nodes in a network can often be organized in latent hierarchical structures, but without a particular underlying taxonomy, the learned node embedding is less useful nor interpretable. In this work, we aim to improve network embedding by modeling the conditional node proximity in networks indicated by node labels residing in real taxonomies. In the meantime, we also aim to model the hierarchical label proximity in the given taxonomies, which is too coarse by solely looking at the hierarchical topologies. Comprehensive experiments and case studies demonstrate the utility of TAXOGAN.

## [666] Semantic Linking Maps for Active Visual Object Search (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Zhen Zeng, Adrian Röfer, Odest Chadwicke Jenkins*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/667](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/667)

**Abstract**:

We aim for mobile robots to function in a variety of common human environments, which requires them to efficiently search previously unseen target objects. We can exploit background knowledge about common spatial relations between landmark objects and target objects to narrow down search space. In this paper, we propose an active visual object search strategy method through our introduction of the Semantic Linking Maps (SLiM) model. SLiM simultaneously maintains the belief over a target object's location as well as landmark objects' locations, while accounting for probabilistic inter-object spatial relations. Based on SLiM, we describe a hybrid search strategy that selects the next best view pose for searching for the target object based on the maintained belief. We demonstrate the efficiency of our SLiM-based search strategy through comparative experiments in simulated environments. We further demonstrate the real-world applicability of SLiM-based search in scenarios with a Fetch mobile manipulation robot.

## [667] Deep Residual Reinforcement Learning (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Shangtong Zhang, Wendelin Boehmer, Shimon Whiteson*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/668](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/668)

**Abstract**:

We revisit residual algorithms in both model-free and model-based reinforcement learning settings. 
We propose the bidirectional target network technique to stabilize residual algorithms, yielding a residual version of DDPG that significantly outperforms vanilla DDPG in commonly used benchmarks. 
Moreover, we find the residual algorithm an effective approach to the distribution mismatch problem in model-based planning. 
Compared with the existing TD(k) method, our residual-based method makes weaker assumptions about the model and yields a greater performance boost.

## [668] Greybox Algorithm Configuration

**Authors**: *Marie Anastacio*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/669](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/669)

**Abstract**:

The performance of state-of-the-art algorithms is highly dependent on their parameter values, and choosing the right configuration can make the difference between solving a problem in a few minutes or hours. Automated algorithm configurators have shown their efficiency on a wide range of applications. However, they still encounter limitations when confronted to a large number of parameters to tune or long algorithm running time.
We believe that there is untapped knowledge that can be gathered from the elements of the configuration problem, such as the default value in the configuration space, the source code of the algorithm, and the distribution of the problem instances at hand. We aim at utilising this knowledge to improve algorithm configurators.

## [669] Bottleneck Identification to Semantic Segmentation of Industrial 3D Point Cloud Scene via Deep Learning

**Authors**: *Romain Cazorla, Line Poinel, Panagiotis Papadakis, Cédric Buche*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/670](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/670)

**Abstract**:

Point cloud acquisition techniques are an essential tool for the digitization of industrial plants, yet the bulk of a designer's work remains manual. A first step to automatize drawing generation is to extract the semantics of the point cloud. Towards this goal, we investigate the use of deep learning to semantically segment oil and gas industrial scenes. We focus on domain characteristics such as high variation of object size, increased concavity and lack of annotated data, which hampers the use of conventional approaches. To address these issues, we advocate the use of synthetic data, adaptive downsampling and context sharing.

## [670] Multi-agent Approach to Resource Allocation in Autonomous Vehicle Fleets

**Authors**: *Alaa Daoud*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/671](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/671)

**Abstract**:

The development of autonomous vehicles, capable of peer-to-peer communication, as well as the interest in on-demand solutions, are the primary motivations for this study. In the absence of central control, we are interested in forming a fleet of autonomous vehicles capable of responding to city-scale travel demands. 
Typically, this problem is solved centrally; this implies that the vehicles have continuous access to a dispatching portal. However, such access to such a global switching infrastructure (for data collection and order delivery) is costly and represents a critical bottleneck. The idea is to use low-cost vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technologies to coordinate vehicles without a global communication infrastructure.
We propose to model the different aspects of decision and optimization problems related to this more general problem. After modeling these problems, the question arises as to the choice of centralized and decentralized solution methods. Methodologically, we explore the directions and compare the performance of distributed constraint optimization techniques (DCOP), self-organized multi-agent techniques, market-based approaches, and centralized operations research solutions.

Experiments show that the solver can find algorithms which perform better than or comparable to state-of-the-art methods, and can even find new best solutions for some instances of standard benchmark sets.

## [672] Distributional Metareasoning for Heuristic Search

**Authors**: *Tianyi Gu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/673](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/673)

**Abstract**:

Heuristic search methods are widely used in many real-world autonomous systems. Yet, people always want to solve search problems that are larger than time allows. To address these challenging problems, even suboptimally, a planning agent should be smart enough to intelligently allocate its computational resources, to think carefully about where in the state space it should spend time searching. For finding optimal solutions, we must examine every node that is not provably too expensive. In contrast, to find suboptimal solutions when under time pressure, we need to be very selective about which nodes to examine. In this work, we will demonstrate that estimates of uncertainty, represented as belief distributions, can be used to drive search effectively.  This type of algorithmic approach is known as metareasoning, which refers to reasoning about which reasoning to do. We will provide examples of improved algorithms for real-time search, bounded-cost search, and situated planning.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/674](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/674)

**Abstract**:

Online forum that gathers participants together to solve the common issues that they are facing is considered as a promising application of utilizing collective intelligence to solve complicated real-world problems.
To facilitate the discussions in online forum to proceed smoothly and to build consensus efficiently, human facilitators are introduced into the system.
With the increasing sophistication of online forum, human facilitators related problems such as human bias and restricted scale become critical. 
Therefore, it is critical to explore approaches to support human facilitators in conducting facilitation.
However, most of the existing facilitation support techniques only support predefined facilitation tasks that could be defined by static rules.
In this research, we aim to explore potential solutions for supporting the human facilitators to conduct facilitation in online forum.
As the first step, we have proposed a case-based reasoning (CBR)-based framework that targets support facilitation by utilizing past successful facilitation experience. 
Currently, our work is focusing on the specific facilitation task of detecting influential user in the online forum. 
In the future work, we are planning to propose approaches of solving other specific facilitation tasks such as measuring the level of agreement and encouraging participants to reach a consensus.

## [675] Towards Robust Dynamic Network Embedding

**Authors**: *Chengbin Hou, Ke Tang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/676](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/676)

**Abstract**:

Dynamic Network Embedding (DNE) has recently drawn much attention due to the dynamic nature of many real-world networks. Comparing to a static network, a dynamic network has a unique character called the degree of changes, which can be defined as the average number of the changed edges between consecutive snapshots spanning a dynamic network. The degree of changes could be quite different even for the dynamic networks generated from the same dataset. It is natural to ask whether existing DNE methods are effective and robust w.r.t. the degree of changes. Towards robust DNE, we suggest two important scenarios. One is to investigate the robustness w.r.t. different slicing settings that are used to generate different dynamic networks with different degree of changes, while another focuses more on the robustness w.r.t. different number of changed edges over timesteps.

## [676] An Information-Theoretic Approach on Causal Structure Learning for Heterogeneous Data Characteristics of Real-World Scenarios

**Abstract**:

While the knowledge about the structures of a systemâ€™s underlying causal relationships is crucial within many real-world scenarios, the omnipresence of heterogeneous data characteristics impedes applying methods for causal structure learning (CSL).
In this dissertation project, we reduce the barriers for the transfer of CSL into practice with threefold contributions: 
(1) We derive an information-theoretic conditional independence test that, incorporated into methods for CSL, improves the accuracy for non-linear and mixed discrete-continuous causal relationships; 
(2) We develop a modular pipeline that covers the essential components required for a comprehensive benchmarking to support the transferability into practice; 
(3) We evaluate opportunities and challenges of CSL within different real-world scenarios from genetics and discrete manufacturing to demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in practice.

**Abstract**:

Imitation learning allows learning complex behaviors given demonstrations. Early approaches belonging to either Behavior Cloning or Inverse Reinforcement Learning were however of limited scalability to complex environments. A more promising approach termed as Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning tackles the imitation learning problem by drawing a connection with Generative Adversarial Networks. In this work, we advocate the use of this class of methods and investigate possible extensions by endowing them with global temporal consistency, in particular through a contrastive learning based approach.

We will introduce task planning algorithms that adapt to the environment and other agents, as well as reinforcement learning methods that are practical for service robot systems. Taken together, this work will make a significant step towards creating general-purpose service robots.

**Abstract**:

In most facility location research, either an efficient facility placement which minimizes the total cost or a fairer placement which minimizes the maximum cost are typically proposed. To find a solution that is both fair and efficient, we propose converting the agent costs to utilities and placing the facility/ies such that the product of utilities, also known as the Nash welfare, is maximized. We ask whether the Nash welfare's well-studied balance between fairness and efficiency also applies to the facility location setting, and what agent strategic behaviour may occur under this facility placement.

Time series analysis has gained a lot of interest during the last decade with diverse applications in a large range of domains such as medicine, physic, and industry. The field of time series classification has been particularly active recently with the development of more and more efficient methods. However, the existing methods assume that the input time series is free of uncertainty. However, there are applications in which uncertainty is so important that it can not be neglected. This project aims to build efficient, robust, and interpretable classification methods for uncertain time series.

**Abstract**:

Since knowledge engineering is an inherently challenging and somewhat unbounded task, machine learning has been widely proposed as an alternative. In real world scenarios, we often need to explicitly model multiple agents, where intelligent agents act towards achieving goals either by coordinating with the other agents or by overseeing the opponents moves, if in a competitive context. We consider the knowledge acquisition problem where agents have knowledge about the world and other agents and then acquire new knowledge (both about the world as well as other agents) in service of answering queries. We propose a model of implicit learning, or more generally, learning to reason, which bypasses the intractable step of producing an explicit representation of the learned knowledge. We show that polynomial-time learnability results can be obtained when limited to knowledge bases and observations consisting of conjunctions of modal literals.

## [685] Towards an Explainer-agnostic Conversational XAI

**Authors**: *Navid Nobani, Fabio Mercorio, Mario Mezzanzanica*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/686](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/686)

**Abstract**:

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is gaining interests in both academia and industry, mainly thanks to the proliferation of darker more complex black-box solutions which are replacing their more transparent ancestors. Believing that the overall performance of an XAI system can be augmented by considering the end-user as a human being, we are studying the ways we can improve the explanations by making them more informative and easier to use from one hand, and interactive and customisable from the other hand.

## [686] Hardware-friendly Deep Learning by Network Quantization and Binarization

**Authors**: *Haotong Qin*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/687](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/687)

**Abstract**:

Quantization is emerging as an efficient approach to promote hardware-friendly deep learning and run deep neural networks on resource-limited hardware. However, it still causes a significant decrease to the network in accuracy. We summarize challenges of quantization into two categories: Quantization for Diverse Architectures and Quantization on Complex Scenes. Our studies focus mainly on applying quantization on various architectures and scenes and pushing the limit of quantization to extremely compress and accelerate networks. The comprehensive research on quantization will achieve more powerful, more efficient, and more flexible hardware-friendly deep learning, and make it better suited to more real-world applications.

## [687] Modeling Institutions in Socio-Ecosystems

**Authors**: *Sitraka Oliva Raharivelo, Jean-Pierre Müller*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/688](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/688)

**Abstract**:

In socio-ecosystems, human activities are structured in time and space by interactions between different regulatory systems with different collective goals. These regulatory systems are modeled by institutions and organizations, and the regulatory mechanisms by norms applied to agents in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). However, little is said about sharing resources, space and time. In particular,  temporal and spatial expressivity is often limited in MAS for institutions and norms. This research  proposes an institutional MAS model capable of representing multiple institutions and norms in the socio-ecosystem, in order to account for the multiplicity of interactions through agents, resources, space and time. We propose an extension of Descriptive Logic for the description of institutions and norms, and use Allen's algebra and the RCC8 to represent time and space. The resulting model allows us to know the norms applicable to an agent located socially, spatially and temporally.

## [688] Inter-Task Similarity for Lifelong Reinforcement Learning in Heterogeneous Tasks

**Authors**: *Sergio A. Serrano*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/689](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/689)

**Abstract**:

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a learning paradigm in which an agent interacts with the environment it inhabits to learn in a trial-and-error way. By letting the agent acquire knowledge from its own experience, RL has been successfully applied to complex domains such as robotics. However, for non-trivial problems, training an RL agent can take very long periods of time. Lifelong machine learning (LML) is a learning setting in which the agent learns to solve tasks sequentially, by leveraging knowledge accumulated from previously solved tasks to learn better/faster in a new one. Most LML works heavily rely on the assumption that tasks are similar to each other. However, this may not be true for some domains with a high degree of task-diversity that could benefit from adopting a lifelong learning approach, e.g., service robotics. Therefore, in this research we will address the problem of learning to solve a sequence of RL heterogeneous tasks (i.e., tasks that differ in their state-action space).

**Abstract**:

Taxonomies provide a structured representation of semantic relations between lexical terms, acting as the backbone of many applications. The research proposed herein addresses the topic of taxonomy enrichment using an ”human-in-the-loop” semi-supervised approach. I will be investigating possible ways to extend and enrich a taxonomy using corpora of unstructured text data. The objective is to develop a methodological framework potentially applicable to any domain.

## [690] Continual Lifelong Learning for Intelligent Agents

**Authors**: *Ghada Sokar*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/691](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/691)

**Abstract**:

Deep neural networks have achieved outstanding performance in many machine learning tasks. However, this remarkable success is achieved in a closed and static environment where the model is trained using large training data of a single task and deployed for testing on data with a similar distribution. Once the model is deployed, it becomes fixed and inflexible to new knowledge. This contradicts real-world applications, in which agents interact with open and dynamic environments and deal with non-stationary data. This Ph.D. research aims to propose efficient approaches that can develop intelligent agents capable of accumulating new knowledge and adapting to new environments without forgetting the previously learned ones.

## [691] Learning from Multimedia Data with Incomplete Information

**Authors**: *Renshuai Tao*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/692](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/692)

**Abstract**:

Traditional deep learning methods are based on the condition that the data is of high-quality, which means the data information is highly available. However, data in these scenes often have the characteristics of large background noise, lack of sample content, small target, serious occlusion and a small number of samples. The application of related tasks in real open scenarios is very important, so it is urgent to make full use of these incomplete information data accurately.

## [692] Data Efficient Algorithms and Interpretability Requirements for Personalized Assessment of Taskable AI Systems

**Authors**: *Pulkit Verma*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/693](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/693)

**Abstract**:

The vast diversity of internal designs of black-box AI systems and their nuanced zones of safe functionality make it difficult for a layperson to use them without unintended side effects. The focus of my dissertation is to develop algorithms and requirements of interpretability that would enable a user to assess and understand the limits of an AI system's safe operability. We develop an assessment module that lets an AI system execute high-level instruction sequences in simulators and answer the user queries about its execution of sequences of actions. Our results show that such a primitive query-response capability is sufficient to efficiently derive a user-interpretable model of the system in stationary, fully observable, and deterministic settings.

## [693] Adversarial Examples in Physical World

**Authors**: *Jiakai Wang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/694](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/694)

**Abstract**:

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have already made fairly high achievements and a very wide range of impact, their vulnerability attracts lots of interest of researchers towards related studies about artificial intelligence (AI) safety and robustness this year. A series of works reveals that the current DNNs are always misled by elaborately designed adversarial examples. And unfortunately, this peculiarity also affects real-world AI applications and places them at potential risk.  we are more interested in physical attacks due to their implementability in the real world. The study of physical attacks can effectively promote the application of AI techniques, which is of great significance to the security development of AI.

## [694] Learning and Planning Under Uncertainty for Green Security

**Authors**: *Lily Xu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/695](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/695)

**Abstract**:

Green security concerns the protection of the world's wildlife, forests, and fisheries from poaching, illegal logging, and illegal fishing. Unfortunately, conservation efforts in green security domains are constrained by the limited availability of defenders, who must patrol vast areas to protect from attackers. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been developed for green security and other security settings, such as US Coast Guard patrols and airport screenings, but effective deployment of AI in these settings requires learning adversarial behavior and planning in complex environments where the true dynamics may be unknown. My research develops novel techniques in machine learning and game theory to enable the effective development and deployment of AI in these resource-constrained settings. Notably, my work has spanned the pipeline from learning in a supervised setting, planning in stochastic environments, sequential planning in uncertain environments, and deployment in the real world. The overarching goal is to optimally allocate scarce resources under uncertainty for environmental conservation.

## [695] An Automated Framework for Supporting Data-Governance Rule Compliance in Decentralized MIMO Contexts

**Authors**: *Rui Zhao*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/696](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/696)

**Abstract**:

We propose Dr.Aid, a logic-based AI framework for automated compliance checking of data governance rules over data-flow graphs. The rules are modelled using a formal language based on situation calculus and are suitable for decentralized contexts with multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) processes. Dr.Aid models data rules and flow rules and checks compliance by reasoning about the propagation, combination, modification and application of data rules over the data flow graphs. Our approach is driven and evaluated by real-world datasets using provenance graphs from data-intensive research.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/697](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/697)

**Abstract**:

Anomaly mining is an important problem that finds numerous applications in various real world do- mains such as environmental monitoring, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare and medicine, to name a few. In this article, I focus on two areas, (1) point-cloud and (2) graph-based anomaly mining. I aim to present a broad view of each area, and discuss classes of main research problems, recent trends and future directions. I conclude with key take-aways and overarching open problems. 

Disclaimer. I try to provide an overview of past and recent trends in both areas within 4 pages. Undoubtedly, these are my personal view of the trends, which can be organized differently. For brevity, I omit all technical details and refer to corresponding papers. Again, due to space limit, it is not possible to include all (even most relevant) references, but a few representative examples.

## [697] From Computational Social Choice to Digital Democracy

**Authors**: *Markus Brill*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/698](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/698)

**Abstract**:

Digital Democracy (aka e-democracy or interactive democracy) aims to enhance democratic decision-making processes by utilizing digital technology. A common goal of these approaches is to make collective decision-making more engaging, inclusive, and responsive to participants' opinions. For example, online decision-making platforms often provide much more flexibility and interaction possibilities than traditional democratic systems. It is without doubt that the successful design of digital democracy systems presents a multidisciplinary research challenge. I argue that tools and techniques from computational social choice should be employed to aid the design of online decision-making platforms and other digital democracy systems.

## [698] Adaptive Experimental Design for Optimizing Combinatorial Structures

**Authors**: *Janardhan Rao Doppa*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/699](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/699)

**Abstract**:

Scientists and engineers in diverse domains need to perform expensive experiments to optimize combinatorial spaces, where each candidate input is a discrete structure (e.g., sequence, tree, graph) or a hybrid structure (mixture of discrete and continuous design variables). For example, in hardware design optimization over locations of processing cores and communication links for data transfer, design evaluation involves performing a computationally-expensive simulation. These experiments are often performed in a heuristic manner by humans and without any formal reasoning. In this paper, we first describe the key challenges in solving these problems in the framework of Bayesian optimization (BO) and our progress over the last five years in addressing these challenges. We also discuss exciting sustainability applications in domains such as electronic design automation, nanoporous materials science, biological sequence design, and electric transportation systems.

Of the several aspects that characterise the behaviour of intelligent agents, I primarily study sequential decision making, learning, and exploration. My interests also extend to broader questions on the effects of AI on life and society. In this paper, I present four distinct investigations drawn from my recent work, which range from theoretical to applied, and which involve both analysis and design. I also share my outlook as an early-career researcher.

## [700] Safe Weakly Supervised Learning

**Authors**: *Yu-Feng Li*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/701](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/701)

**Abstract**:

Weakly supervised learning (WSL) refers to learning from a large amount of weak supervision data. This includes i) incomplete supervision (e.g., semi-supervised learning);  ii) inexact supervision (e.g., multi-instance learning) and iii) inaccurate supervision (e.g., label noise learning). Unlike supervised learning which typically achieves performance improvement with more labeled data, WSL may sometimes even degenerate performance with more weak supervision data. It is thus desired to study safe WSL, which could robustly improve performance with weak supervision data. In this article, we share our understanding of the problem from in-distribution data to out-of-distribution data, and discuss possible ways to alleviate it, from the aspects of worst-case analysis, ensemble-learning, and bi-level optimization. We also share some open problems, to inspire future researches.

## [701] Width-Based Algorithms for Common Problems in Control, Planning and Reinforcement Learning

**Authors**: *Nir Lipovetzky*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/702](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/702)

**Abstract**:

Width-based algorithms search for solutions through a general definition of state novelty. These algorithms have been shown to result in state-of-the-art performance in classical planning, and have been successfully applied to model-based and model-free settings where the dynamics of the problem are given through simulation engines. Width-based algorithms performance is understood theoretically through the notion of planning width, providing polynomial guarantees on their runtime and memory consumption. To facilitate synergies across research communities, this paper summarizes the area of width-based planning, and surveys current and future research directions.

## [702] Towards a New Generation of Cognitive Diagnosis

**Authors**: *Qi Liu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/703](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/703)

**Abstract**:

Cognitive diagnosis is a type of assessment for automatically measuring individuals' proficiency profiles from their observed behaviors, e.g. quantifying the mastery level of examinees on specific knowledge concepts/skills. As one of the fundamental research tasks in domains like intelligent education, a number of Cognitive Diagnosis Models (CDMs) have been developed in the past decades. Though these solutions are usually well designed based on psychometric theories, they still suffer from the limited ability of the handcrafted diagnosis functions, especially when dealing with heterogeneous data. In this paper, I will share my personal understanding of cognitive diagnosis and review our recent developments of CDMs mostly from a machine learning perspective. Meanwhile, I will show the wide applications of cognitive diagnosis.

This paper reviews current AI solutions towards road traffic congestion alleviation. Three specific AI technologies are discussed, (1) intersection management protocols for coordinating vehicles through a roads intersection in a safe and efficient manner, (2) road pricing protocol that induce optimized traffic flow, and (3) partial or full autonomous driving that can stabilize traffic flow and mitigate adverse traffic shock waves. The paper briefly presents the challenges affiliated with each of these applications along with an overview of state-of-the-art solutions. Finally, real-world implementation gaps and challenges are discussed.

My research in the past few years has focused on fostering trust in algorithmic systems. I often analyze scenarios where a variety of desirable trust-oriented goals must be simultaneously satisfied; 
for example, ensuring that an allocation mechanism is both fair and efficient, or that a model explanation framework is both effective and differentially private. 
This interdisciplinary approach requires tools from a variety of computer science disciplines, such as game theory, economics, ML and differential privacy.

## [705] A Neural Network Auction For Group Decision Making Over a Continuous Space

**Authors**: *Yoram Bachrach, Ian Gemp, Marta Garnelo, János Kramár, Tom Eccles, Dan Rosenbaum, Thore Graepel*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/706](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/706)

**Abstract**:

We propose a system for conducting an auction over locations in a continuous space. It enables participants to express their preferences over possible choices of location in the space, selecting the location that maximizes the total utility of all agents. We prevent agents from tricking the system into selecting a location that improves their individual utility at the expense of others by using a pricing rule that gives agents no incentive to misreport their true preferences. 

The system queries participants for their utility in many random locations, then trains a neural network to approximate the preference function of each participant. The parameters of these neural network models are transmitted and processed by the auction mechanism, which composes these into differentiable models that are optimized through gradient ascent to compute the final chosen location and charged prices.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/707](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/707)

**Abstract**:

In this work, we treat web interoperability in terms of interchanging ontologies (as knowledge models) within user-centred ontology engineering environments, involving visual and serialised representations of ontologies.
To do this, we deal with the tool interoperability problem by re-using an enough expressive ontology-driven metamodel, named KF, proposed as a bridge for interchanging both knowledge models.
We provide an extensible web framework, named crowd 2.0,  unifying the standard conceptual data modelling languages for generating OWL 2 ontologies from semantic visualisations. Visual models are designed as UML, ER or ORM 2 diagrams, represented as KF instances, and finally, formalised as DL-based models. Reasoning results may be newly incorporated into the shared KF instance to be visualised in any of the provided languages.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/708](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/708)

**Abstract**:

In this paper, we present Skills2Graph, a tool that, starting from a set of users’ professional skills, identifies the most suitable jobs as they emerge from a large corpus of 2.5M+ Online Job Vacancies (OJVs) posted in three different countries (the United Kingdom, France, and Germany). To this aim, we rely both on co-occurrence statistics - computing a count-based measure of skill-relevance named Revealed Comparative Advantage (rca) - and distributional semantics - generating several embeddings on the OJVs corpus and performing an intrinsic evaluation of their quality. Results, evaluated through a user study of 10 labor market experts, show a high P@3 for the recommendations provided by Skills2Graph, and a high nDCG (0.985 and 0.984 in a [0,1] range), that indicates a strong correlation between the experts’ scores and the rankings generated by Skills2Graph.

In this demonstration, we develop an interactive tool, HIVE, to demonstrate the ability and versatility of an explainable risk ranking model with a special focus on financial use cases. HIVE is a web-based tool that provides users with automated highlighted financial statements, and HIVE is designed for making comparing statements rather more efficient. Moreover, with the proposed tool, users can find related reports at ease, and we believe that HIVE can benefit both academics and practitioners in finance as they can work around deep learning models with their newly gained insights.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/712](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/712)

**Abstract**:

Transformer-based deep learning models have increasingly demonstrated high accuracy on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we propose a compression-compilation co-design framework that can guarantee the identified model meets both resource and real-time specifications of mobile devices. Our framework applies a compiler-aware neural architecture optimization method (CANAO), which can generate the optimal compressed model that balances both accuracy and latency. We are able to achieve up to 7.8x speedup compared with TensorFlow-Lite with only minor accuracy loss. We present two types of BERT applications on mobile devices: Question Answering (QA) and Text Generation. Both can be executed in real-time with latency as low as 45ms. Videos for demonstrating the framework can be found on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WIRvK_2PZI

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/713](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/713)

**Abstract**:

The use of machine learning rapidly increases in high-risk scenarios where decisions are required, for example in healthcare or industrial monitoring equipment. In crucial situations, a model that can offer meaningful explanations of its decision-making is essential. In industrial facilities, the equipment's well-timed maintenance is vital to ensure continuous operation to prevent money loss. Using machine learning, predictive and prescriptive maintenance attempt to anticipate and prevent eventual system failures. This paper introduces a visualisation tool incorporating interpretations to display information derived from predictive maintenance models, trained on time-series data.

## [714] Towards Fast and Accurate Multi-Person Pose Estimation on Mobile Devices

**Authors**: *Xuan Shen, Geng Yuan, Wei Niu, Xiaolong Ma, Jiexiong Guan, Zhengang Li, Bin Ren, Yanzhi Wang*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/715](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/715)

**Abstract**:

The rapid development of autonomous driving, abnormal behavior detection, and behavior recognition makes an increasing demand for multi-person pose estimation-based applications, especially on mobile platforms. However, to achieve high accuracy, state-of-the-art methods tend to have a large model size and complex post-processing algorithm, which costs intense computation and long end-to-end latency. To solve this problem, we propose an architecture optimization and weight pruning framework to accelerate inference of multi-person pose estimation on mobile devices. With our optimization framework, we achieve up to 2.51X faster model inference speed with higher accuracy compared to representative lightweight multi-person pose estimator.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of millions across the globe. In Singapore, promoting safe distancing by managing crowds in public areas have been the cornerstone of containing the community spread of the virus. One of the most important solutions to maintain social distancing is to monitor the crowdedness of indoor and outdoor points of interest. Using Nanyang Technological University (NTU) as a testbed, we develop and deploy a platform that provides live and predicted crowd counts for key locations on campus to help users plan their trips in an informed manner, so as to mitigate the risk of community transmission.

## [716] Graph-Augmented Code Summarization in Computational Notebooks

**Authors**: *April Yi Wang, Dakuo Wang, Xuye Liu, Lingfei Wu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/717](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/717)

**Abstract**:

Computational notebooks allow data scientists to express their ideas through a combination of code and documentation. However, data scientists often pay attention only to the code and neglect the creation of the documentation in a notebook. In this work, we present a human-centered automation system, Themisto, that can support users to easily create documentation via three approaches: 1) We have developed and reported a GNN-augmented code documentation generation algorithm in a previous paper, which can generate documentation for a given source code; 2) Themisto also implements a query-based approach to retrieve the online API documentation as the summary for certain types of source code; 3) Lastly, Themistoalso enables a user prompt approach to motivate users to write documentation for some use cases that automation does not work well.

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/718](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/718)

**Abstract**:

Diagnosis and treatment for Parkinson's disease rely on the evaluation of motor functions, which is expensive and time consuming when performing at clinics. It is also difficult for patients to record correct movements at home without the guidance from experienced physicians. To help patients with Parkinson’s disease get better evaluation from in-home recorded movement videos, we developed an interactive video acquisition and learning system for clinical motor assessments. The system provides real-time guidance with multi-level body keypoint tracking and analysis to patients, which guarantees correct understanding and performing of clinical tasks. We tested its effectiveness on healthy subjects, and the efficiency and usability on patient groups. Experiments showed that our system enabled high quality video recordings following clinical standards, benefiting both patients and physicians. Our system provides a novel learning-based telemedicine approach for the care of patients with Parkinson’s disease.

**Authors**: *Miao Xie, Wotao Yin, Huan Xu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/719](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/719)

**Abstract**:

Recently online multi-armed bandit (MAB) is growing rapidly, as novel problem settings and algorithms motivated by various practical applications are being studied, building on the top of the classic bandit problem. However, identifying the best bandit algorithm from lots of potential candidates for a given application is not only time-consuming but also relying on human expertise, which hinders the practicality of MAB. To alleviate this problem, this paper outlines an intelligent system called AutoBandit, equipped with many out-of-the-box MAB algorithms, for automatically and adaptively choosing the best with suitable hyper-parameters online. It is effective to help a growing application for continuously maximizing cumulative rewards of its whole life-cycle. With a flexible architecture and user-friendly web-based interfaces, it is very convenient for the user to integrate and monitor online bandits in a business system. At the time of publication, AutoBandit has been deployed for various industrial applications.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/720](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/720)

**Abstract**:

Federated Edge Learning (FEL) is a distributed Machine Learning (ML) framework for collaborative training on edge devices. FEL improves data privacy over traditional centralized ML model training by keeping data on the devices and only sending local model updates to a central coordinator for aggregation. However, challenges still remain in existing FEL architectures where there is high communication overhead between edge devices and the coordinator. In this paper, we present a working prototype of blockchain-empowered and communication-efficient FEL framework, which enhances the security and scalability towards large-scale implementation of FEL.

## [720] IIAS: An Intelligent Insurance Assessment System through Online Real-time Conversation Analysis

**Authors**: *Mengdi Zhou, Shuang Peng, Minghui Yang, Nan Li, Hongbin Wang, Li Qiao, Haitao Mi, Zujie Wen, Teng Xu, Lei Liu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2021*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/721](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2021/721)

**Abstract**:

With the development of Chinese medical insurance industry, the amount of claim cases is growing rapidly. Ultimately, more claims necessarily indicate that the insurance company has to spend much time assessing claims and decides how much compensation the claimant should receive, which is a highly professional process that involves many complex operations. Therefore, the insurance assessor's role is essential. However, for the junior assessor often lacking in practical experience, it is not easy to quickly handle such an online procedure. In order to alleviate assessors' cognitive workload, we propose an Intelligent Insurance Assessment System (IIAS) that helps effectively collect claimant information through online real-time conversation analysis. With the assistance of IIAS, the average time cost of the insurance assessment procedure is reduced from 55 minutes to 35 minutes.
