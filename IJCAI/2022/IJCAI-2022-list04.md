**Abstract**:

Document-level relation extraction aims to extract relations between entities in a document. In contrast to sentence-level relation extraction, it deals with longer texts and more complex entity interactions, which requires reasoning over multiple sentences with rich reasoning skills. Most current researches construct a document-level graph first, and then focus on the overall graph structure or the paths between the target entity pair in the graph. In this paper, we propose a novel subgraph reasoning (SGR) framework for document-level relation extraction. SGR combines the advantages of both graph-based models and path-based models, integrating various paths between the target entity pair into a much simpler subgraph structure to perform relational reasoning. Moreover, the paths generated by our designed heuristic strategy explicitly model the requisite reasoning skills and roughly cover the supporting sentences for each relation instance. Experimental results on DocRED show that SGR outperforms existing models, and further analyses demonstrate that our method is both effective and explainable. Our code is available at https://github.com/Crysta1ovo/SGR.

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/602](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/602)

**Abstract**:

Document-level Event Factuality Identification (DEFI) predicts the event factuality according to the current document, and mainly depends on event-related tokens and sentences. However, previous studies relied on annotated information and did not filter irrelevant and noisy texts. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end model, i.e., Reinforced Multi-Granularity Hierarchical Attention Network (RMHAN), which can learn information at different levels of granularity from tokens and sentences hierarchically. Moreover, with hierarchical reinforcement learning, RMHAN first selects relevant and meaningful tokens, and then selects useful sentences for document-level encoding. Experimental results on DLEF-v2 corpus show that RMHAN model outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines and achieves the best performance.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/603](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/603)

**Abstract**:

The deep neural networks, such as the Deep-FSMN, have been widely studied for keyword spotting (KWS) applications. However, computational resources for these networks are significantly constrained since they usually run on-call on edge devices. In this paper, we present BiFSMN, an accurate and extreme-efficient binary neural network for KWS. We first construct a High-frequency Enhancement Distillation scheme for the binarization-aware training, which emphasizes the high-frequency information from the full-precision network's representation that is more crucial for the optimization of the binarized network. Then, to allow the instant and adaptive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime, we also propose a Thinnable Binarization Architecture to further liberate the acceleration potential of the binarized network from the topology perspective. Moreover, we implement a Fast Bitwise Computation Kernel for BiFSMN on ARMv8 devices which fully utilizes registers and increases instruction throughput to push the limit of deployment efficiency. Extensive experiments show that BiFSMN outperforms existing binarization methods by convincing margins on various datasets and is even comparable with the full-precision counterpart (e.g., less than 3% drop on Speech Commands V1-12). We highlight that benefiting from the thinnable architecture and the optimized 1-bit implementation, BiFSMN can achieve an impressive 22.3x speedup and 15.5x storage-saving on real-world edge hardware.

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/604](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/604)

**Abstract**:

Semantic parsing is an important NLP problem, particularly for voice assistants such as Alexa and Google Assistant. State-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic parsers are seq2seq architectures based on large language models that have been pretrained on vast amounts of text. To better leverage that pretraining, recent work has explored a reformulation of semantic parsing whereby the output sequences are themselves natural language sentences, but in a controlled fragment of natural language. This approach delivers strong results, particularly for few-shot semantic parsing, which is of key importance in practice and the focus of our paper. We push this line of work forward by introducing an automated methodology that delivers very significant additional improvements by utilizing modest amounts of unannotated data, which is typically easy to obtain. Our method is based on a novel synthesis of four techniques: joint training with auxiliary unsupervised tasks; constrained decoding; self-training; and paraphrasing. We show that this method delivers new SOTA few-shot performance on the Overnight dataset, particularly in very low-resource settings, and very compelling few-shot results on a new semantic parsing dataset.

## [604] Relational Triple Extraction: One Step is Enough

**Authors**: *Yuming Shang, Heyan Huang, Xin Sun, Wei Wei, Xian-Ling Mao*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/605](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/605)

**Abstract**:

Extracting relational triples from unstructured text is an essential task in natural language processing and knowledge graph construction. Existing approaches usually contain two fundamental steps: (1) finding the boundary positions of head and tail entities; (2) concatenating specific tokens to form triples. However, nearly all previous methods suffer from the problem of error accumulation, i.e., the boundary recognition error of each entity in step (1) will be accumulated into the final combined triples. To solve the problem, in this paper, we introduce a fresh perspective to revisit the triple extraction task and propose a simple but effective model, named DirectRel.  Specifically, the proposed model first generates candidate entities through enumerating token sequences in a sentence, and then transforms the triple extraction task into a linking problem on a ``head -> tail" bipartite graph. By doing so, all triples can be directly extracted in only one step. Extensive experimental results on two widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed model performs better than the state-of-the-art baselines.

## [605] A Unified Strategy for Multilingual Grammatical Error Correction with Pre-trained Cross-Lingual Language Model

**Authors**: *Xin Sun, Tao Ge, Shuming Ma, Jingjing Li, Furu Wei, Houfeng Wang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/606](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/606)

**Abstract**:

Synthetic data construction of Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) for non-English languages relies heavily on human-designed and language-specific rules, which produce limited error-corrected patterns. In this paper, we propose a generic and language-independent strategy for multilingual GEC, which can train a GEC system effectively for a new non-English language with only two easy-to-access resources: 1) a pre-trained cross-lingual language model (PXLM) and 2) parallel translation data between English and the language. 
Our approach creates diverse parallel GEC data without any language-specific operations by taking the non-autoregressive translation generated by PXLM and the gold translation as error-corrected sentence pairs. Then, we reuse PXLM to initialize the GEC model and pre-train it with the synthetic data generated by itself, which yields further improvement. We evaluate our approach on three public benchmarks of GEC in different languages. It achieves the state-of-the-art results on the NLPCC 2018 Task 2 dataset (Chinese) and obtains competitive performance on Falko-Merlin (German) and RULEC-GEC (Russian). Further analysis demonstrates that our data construction method is complementary to rule-based approaches.

## [606] On Tracking Dialogue State by Inheriting Slot Values in Mentioned Slot Pools

**Authors**: *Zhoujian Sun, Zhengxing Huang, Nai Ding*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/607](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/607)

**Abstract**:

Dialogue state tracking (DST) is a component of the task oriented dialogue system. It is responsible for extracting and managing slots, where each slot represents a part of the information to accomplish a task, and slot value is updated recurrently in each dialogue turn. However, many DST models cannot update slot values appropriately. These models may repeatedly inherit wrong slot values extracted in previous turns, resulting in the fail of the entire DST task. They cannot update indirectly mentioned slots well, either. This study designed a model with a mentioned slot pool (MSP) to tackle the update problem. The MSP is a slot specific memory that records all mentioned slot values that may be inherited, and our model updates slot values according to the MSP and the dialogue context. Our model rejects inheriting the previous slot value when it predicates the value is wrong. Then, it extracts the slot value from the current dialogue context. As the contextual information accumulates, the new value is more likely to be correct. It also can track the indirectly mentioned slot by picking a value from the MSP. Experimental results showed our model reached state of the art DST performance on MultiWOZ datasets.

## [607] Towards Discourse-Aware Document-Level Neural Machine Translation

**Authors**: *Xin Tan, Longyin Zhang, Fang Kong, Guodong Zhou*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/608](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/608)

**Abstract**:

Current document-level neural machine translation (NMT) systems have achieved remarkable progress with document context. Nevertheless, discourse information that has been proven effective in many NLP tasks is ignored in most previous work. In this work, we aim at incorporating the coherence information hidden within the RST-style discourse structure into machine translation. To achieve it, we propose a document-level NMT system enhanced with the discourse-aware document context, which is named Disco2NMT. Specifically, Disco2NMT models document context based on the discourse dependency structures through a hierarchical architecture. We first convert the RST tree of an article into a dependency structure and then build the graph convolutional network (GCN) upon the segmented EDUs under the guidance of RST dependencies to capture the discourse-aware context for NMT incorporation. We conduct experiments on the document-level English-German and English-Chinese translation tasks with three domains (TED, News, and Europarl). Experimental results show that our Disco2NMT model significantly surpasses both context-agnostic and context-aware baseline systems on multiple evaluation indicators.

## [608] Learning by Interpreting

**Authors**: *Xuting Tang, Abdul Rafae Khan, Shusen Wang, Jia Xu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/609](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/609)

**Abstract**:

This paper introduces a novel way of enhancing NLP prediction accuracy by incorporating model interpretation insights. Conventional efforts often focus on balancing the trade-offs between accuracy and interpretability, for instance, sacrificing model performance to increase the explainability. Here, we take a unique approach and show that model interpretation can ultimately help improve NLP quality. Specifically, we employ our learned interpretability results using attention mechanisms, LIME, and SHAP to train our model. We demonstrate a significant increase in accuracy of up to +3.4  BLEU points on NMT and up to +4.8 points on GLUE tasks, verifying our hypothesis that it is possible to achieve better model learning by incorporating model interpretation knowledge.

## [609] Robust Fine-tuning via Perturbation and Interpolation from In-batch Instances

**Authors**: *Shoujie Tong, Qingxiu Dong, Damai Dai, Yifan Song, Tianyu Liu, Baobao Chang, Zhifang Sui*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/610](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/610)

**Abstract**:

Fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on downstream tasks has become common practice in natural language processing. However, most of the PLMs are vulnerable, e.g., they are brittle under adversarial attacks or imbalanced data, which hinders the application of the PLMs on some downstream tasks, especially in safe-critical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning method called Match-Tuning to force the PLMs to be more robust. For each instance in a batch, we involve other instances in the same batch to interact with it. To be specific, regarding the instances with other labels as a perturbation, Match-Tuning makes the model more robust to noise at the beginning of training. While nearing the end, Match-Tuning focuses more on performing an interpolation among the instances with the same label for better generalization. Extensive experiments on various tasks in GLUE benchmark show that Match-Tuning consistently outperforms the vanilla fine-tuning by 1.64 scores. Moreover, Match-Tuning exhibits remarkable robustness to adversarial attacks and data imbalance.

## [610] MGAD: Learning Descriptional Representation Distilled from Distributional Semantics for Unseen Entities

**Authors**: *Yuanzheng Wang, Xueqi Cheng, Yixing Fan, Xiaofei Zhu, Huasheng Liang, Qiang Yan, Jiafeng Guo*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/611](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/611)

**Abstract**:

Entity representation plays a central role in building effective entity retrieval models. Recent works propose to learn entity representations based on entity-centric contexts, which achieve SOTA performances on many tasks. However, these methods lead to poor representations for unseen entities since they rely on a multitude of occurrences for each entity to enable accurate representations. To address this issue, we propose to learn enhanced descriptional representations for unseen entities by distilling knowledge from distributional semantics into descriptional embeddings. Specifically, we infer enhanced embeddings for unseen entities based on descriptions by aligning the descriptional embedding space to the distributional embedding space with different granularities, i.e., element-level, batch-level and space-level alignment. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show that our approach improves the performance over all baseline methods. In particular, our approach can achieve the effectiveness of the teacher model on almost all entities, and maintain such high performance on unseen entities.

## [611] Unsupervised Context Aware Sentence Representation Pretraining for Multi-lingual Dense Retrieval

**Authors**: *Ning Wu, Yaobo Liang, Houxing Ren, Linjun Shou, Nan Duan, Ming Gong, Daxin Jiang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/612](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/612)

**Abstract**:

Recent research demonstrates the effectiveness of using pretrained language models (PLM) to improve dense retrieval and multilingual dense retrieval. In this work, we present a simple but effective monolingual pretraining task called contrastive context prediction (CCP) to learn sentence representation by modeling sentence level contextual relation. By pushing the embedding of sentences in a local context closer and pushing random negative samples away, different languages could form isomorphic structure, then sentence pairs in two different languages will be automatically aligned.  Our experiments show that model collapse and information leakage are very easy to happen during contrastive training of language model, but language-specific memory bank and asymmetric batch normalization operation play an essential role in preventing collapsing and information leakage, respectively. Besides, a post-processing for sentence embedding is also very effective to achieve better retrieval performance.  On the multilingual sentence retrieval task Tatoeba, our model achieves new SOTA results among methods without using bilingual data. Our model also shows larger gain on Tatoeba when transferring between non-English pairs. On two multi-lingual query-passage retrieval tasks, XOR Retrieve and Mr.TYDI, our model even achieves two SOTA results in both zero-shot and supervised setting among all pretraining models using bilingual data.

## [612] Propose-and-Refine: A Two-Stage Set Prediction Network for Nested Named Entity Recognition

**Authors**: *Shuhui Wu, Yongliang Shen, Zeqi Tan, Weiming Lu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/613](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/613)

**Abstract**:

Nested named entity recognition (nested NER) is a fundamental task in natural language processing. Various span-based methods have been proposed to detect nested entities with span representations. However, span-based methods do not consider the relationship between a span and other entities or phrases, which is helpful in the NER task. Besides, span-based methods have trouble predicting long entities due to limited span enumeration length. To mitigate these issues, we present the Propose-and-Refine Network (PnRNet), a two-stage set prediction network for nested NER. In the propose stage, we use a span-based predictor to generate some coarse entity predictions as entity proposals. In the refine stage, proposals interact with each other, and richer contextual information is incorporated into the proposal representations. The refined proposal representations are used to re-predict entity boundaries and classes. In this way, errors in coarse proposals can be eliminated, and the boundary prediction is no longer constrained by the span enumeration length limitation. Additionally, we build multi-scale sentence representations, which better model the hierarchical structure of sentences and provide richer contextual information than token-level representations. Experiments show that PnRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on four nested NER datasets and one flat NER dataset.

## [613] Neural Subgraph Explorer: Reducing Noisy Information via Target-oriented Syntax Graph Pruning

**Authors**: *Bowen Xing, Ivor W. Tsang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/614](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/614)

**Abstract**:

Recent years have witnessed the emerging success of leveraging syntax graphs for the target sentiment classification task.
However, we discover that existing syntax-based models suffer from two issues:
noisy information aggregation and loss of distant correlations.
In this paper, we propose a novel model termed Neural Subgraph Explorer, which 
(1) reduces the noisy information via pruning target-irrelevant nodes on the syntax graph;
(2) introduces beneficial first-order connections between the target and its related words into the obtained graph.
Specifically, we design a multi-hop actions score estimator to evaluate the value of each word regarding the specific target.
The discrete action sequence is sampled through Gumble-Softmax and then used for both of the syntax graph and the self-attention graph.
To introduce the first-order connections between the target and its relevant words, the two pruned graphs are merged.
Finally, graph convolution is conducted on the obtained unified graph to update the hidden states.
And this process is stacked with multiple layers.
To our knowledge, this is the first attempt of target-oriented syntax graph pruning in this task.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

## [614] TaxoPrompt: A Prompt-based Generation Method with Taxonomic Context for Self-Supervised Taxonomy Expansion

**Authors**: *Hongyuan Xu, Yunong Chen, Zichen Liu, Yanlong Wen, Xiaojie Yuan*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/615](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/615)

**Abstract**:

Taxonomies are hierarchical classifications widely exploited to facilitate downstream natural language processing tasks. The taxonomy expansion task aims to incorporate emergent concepts into the existing taxonomies. Prior works focus on modeling the local substructure of taxonomies but neglect the global structure. In this paper, we propose TaxoPrompt, a framework that learns the global structure by prompt tuning with taxonomic context. Prompt tuning leverages a template to formulate downstream tasks into masked language model form for better distributed semantic knowledge use. To further infuse global structure knowledge into language models, we enhance the prompt template by exploiting the taxonomic context constructed by a variant of the random walk algorithm. Experiments on seven public benchmarks show that our proposed TaxoPrompt is effective and efficient in automatically expanding taxonomies and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

## [615] Robust Interpretable Text Classification against Spurious Correlations Using AND-rules with Negation

**Authors**: *Rohan Kumar Yadav, Lei Jiao, Ole-Christoffer Granmo, Morten Goodwin*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/616](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/616)

**Abstract**:

The state-of-the-art natural language processing models have raised the bar for excellent performance on a variety of tasks in recent years. However, concerns are rising over their primitive sensitivity to distribution biases that reside in the training and testing data. This issue hugely impacts the performance of the models when exposed to out-of-distribution and counterfactual data. The root cause seems to be that many machine learning models are prone to learn the shortcuts, modelling simple correlations rather than more fundamental and general relationships. As a result, such text classifiers tend to perform poorly when a human makes minor modifications to the data, which raises questions regarding their robustness. In this paper, we employ a rule-based architecture called Tsetlin Machine (TM) that learns both simple and complex correlations by ANDing features and their negations. As such, it generates explainable AND-rules using negated and non-negated reasoning. Here, we explore how non-negated reasoning can be more prone to distribution biases than negated reasoning. We further leverage this finding by adapting the TM architecture to mainly perform negated reasoning using the specificity parameter s. As a result, the AND-rules becomes robust to spurious correlations and can also correctly predict counterfactual data. Our empirical investigation of the model's robustness uses the specificity s to control the degree of negated reasoning. Experiments on publicly available Counterfactually-Augmented Data demonstrate that the negated clauses are robust to spurious correlations and outperform Naive Bayes, SVM, and Bi-LSTM by up to 20 %, and  ELMo by almost 6 % on counterfactual test data.

## [616] Diversity Features Enhanced Prototypical Network for Few-shot Intent Detection

**Authors**: *Fengyi Yang, Xi Zhou, Yi Wang, Abibulla Atawulla, Ran Bi*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/617](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/617)

**Abstract**:

Few-shot Intent Detection (FSID) is a challenging task in dialogue systems due to the scarcity of available annotated utterances. Although existing few-shot learning approaches have made remarkable progress, they fall short in adapting to the Generalized Few-shot Intent Detection (GFSID) task where both seen and unseen classes are present. A core problem of the simultaneous existence of these two tasks is that limited training samples fail to cover the diversity of user expressions. In this paper, we propose an effective Diversity Features Enhanced Prototypical Network (DFEPN) to enhance diversity features for novel intents by fully exploiting the diversity of known intent samples. Specially, DFEPN generates diversity features of samples in the hidden space via a diversity feature generator module and then fuses these features with original support vectors to get a more suitable prototype vector of each class. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model on both FSID and GFSID tasks, we carry out sufficient experiments on two benchmark intent detection datasets. Results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and keeps stable performance on both two tasks.

## [617] UM4: Unified Multilingual Multiple Teacher-Student Model for Zero-Resource Neural Machine Translation

**Authors**: *Jian Yang, Yuwei Yin, Shuming Ma, Dongdong Zhang, Shuangzhi Wu, Hongcheng Guo, Zhoujun Li, Furu Wei*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/618](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/618)

**Abstract**:

Most translation tasks among languages belong to the zero-resource translation problem where parallel corpora are unavailable. Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) enables one-pass translation using shared semantic space for all languages compared to the two-pass pivot translation but often underperforms the pivot-based method. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named as Unified Multilingual Multiple teacher-student Model for NMT (UM4). Our method unifies source-teacher, target-teacher, and pivot-teacher models to guide the student model for the zero-resource translation. The source teacher and target teacher force the student to learn the direct source-target translation by the distilled knowledge on both source and target sides. The monolingual corpus is further leveraged by the pivot-teacher model to enhance the student model. Experimental results demonstrate that our model of 72 directions significantly outperforms previous methods on the WMT benchmark.

## [618] High-resource Language-specific Training for Multilingual Neural Machine Translation

**Authors**: *Jian Yang, Yuwei Yin, Shuming Ma, Dongdong Zhang, Zhoujun Li, Furu Wei*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/619](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/619)

**Abstract**:

Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) trained in multiple language pairs has attracted considerable attention due to fewer model parameters and lower training costs by sharing knowledge among multiple languages. Nonetheless, multilingual training is plagued by language interference degeneration in shared parameters because of the negative interference among different translation directions, especially on high-resource languages. In this paper, we propose the multilingual translation model with the high-resource language-specific training (HLT-MT) to alleviate the negative interference, which adopts the two-stage training with the language-specific selection mechanism. Specifically, we first train the multilingual model only with the high-resource pairs and select the language-specific modules at the top of the decoder to enhance the translation quality of high-resource directions. Next, the model is further trained on all available corpora to transfer knowledge from high-resource languages (HRLs) to low-resource languages (LRLs). Experimental results show that HLT-MT outperforms various strong baselines on WMT-10 and OPUS-100 benchmarks. Furthermore, the analytic experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the negative interference in multilingual training.

## [619] SyntaSpeech: Syntax-Aware Generative Adversarial Text-to-Speech

**Authors**: *Zhenhui Ye, Zhou Zhao, Yi Ren, Fei Wu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/620](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/620)

**Abstract**:

The recent progress in non-autoregressive text-to-speech (NAR-TTS) has made fast and high-quality speech synthesis possible. However, current NAR-TTS models usually use phoneme sequence as input and thus cannot understand the tree-structured syntactic information of the input sequence, which hurts the prosody modeling. To this end, we propose SyntaSpeech, a syntax-aware and light-weight NAR-TTS model, which integrates tree-structured syntactic information into the prosody modeling modules in PortaSpeech. Specifically, 1) We build a syntactic graph based on the dependency tree of the input sentence, then process the text encoding with a syntactic graph encoder to extract the syntactic information. 2) We incorporate the extracted syntactic encoding with PortaSpeech to improve the prosody prediction. 3) We introduce a multi-length discriminator to replace the flow-based post-net in PortaSpeech, which simplifies the training pipeline and improves the inference speed, while keeping the naturalness of the generated audio. Experiments on three datasets not only show that the tree-structured syntactic information grants SyntaSpeech the ability to synthesize better audio with expressive prosody, but also demonstrate the generalization ability of SyntaSpeech to adapt to multiple languages and multi-speaker text-to-speech. Ablation studies demonstrate the necessity of each component in SyntaSpeech.  Source code and audio samples are available at https://syntaspeech.github.io.

## [620] Clickbait Detection via Contrastive Variational Modelling of Text and Label

**Authors**: *Xiaoyuan Yi, Jiarui Zhang, Wenhao Li, Xiting Wang, Xing Xie*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/621](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/621)

**Abstract**:

Clickbait refers to deliberately created sensational or deceptive text for tricking readers into clicking, which severely hurts the web ecosystem. With a growing number of clickbaits on social media, developing automatic detection methods becomes essential. Nonetheless, the performance of existing neural classifiers is limited due to the underutilization of small labelled datasets. Inspired by related pedagogy theories that learning to write can promote comprehension ability, we propose a novel Contrastive Variational Modelling (CVM) framework to exploit the labelled data better. CVM models the conditional distributions of text and clickbait labels by predicting labels from text and generating text from labels simultaneously with Variational AutoEncoder and further differentiates the learned spaces under each label by a mixed contrastive learning loss. In this way, CVM can capture more underlying textual properties and hence utilize label information to its full potential, boosting detection performance. We theoretically demonstrate CVM as learning a joint distribution of text, clickbait label, and latent variable. Experiments on three clickbait detection datasets show our method's robustness to inadequate and biased labels, outperforming several recent strong baselines.

## [621] Targeted Multimodal Sentiment Classification based on Coarse-to-Fine Grained Image-Target Matching

**Authors**: *Jianfei Yu, Jieming Wang, Rui Xia, Junjie Li*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/622](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/622)

**Abstract**:

Targeted Multimodal Sentiment Classification (TMSC) aims to identify the sentiment polarities over each target mentioned in a pair of sentence and image. Existing methods to TMSC failed to explicitly capture both coarse-grained and fine-grained image-target matching, including 1) the relevance between the image and the target and 2) the alignment between visual objects and the target. To tackle this issue, we propose a new multi-task learning architecture named coarse-to-fine grained Image-Target Matching network (ITM), which jointly performs image-target relevance classification, object-target alignment, and targeted sentiment classification. We further construct an Image-Target Matching dataset by manually annotating the image-target relevance and the visual object aligned with the input target. Experiments on two benchmark TMSC datasets show that our model consistently outperforms the baselines, achieves state-of-the-art results, and presents interpretable visualizations.

**Abstract**:

A quality headline with a high click-rate should not only summarize the content of an article, but also reflect a style that attracts users. Such demand has drawn rising attention to the task of stylistic headline generation (SHG). An intuitive method is to first generate plain headlines leveraged by document-headline parallel data then transfer them to a target style. However, this inevitably suffers from error propagation. Therefore, to unify the two sub-tasks and explicitly decompose style-relevant attributes and summarize content, we propose an end-to-end stage-wise SHG model containing the style generation component and the content insertion component, where the former generates stylistic-relevant intermediate outputs and the latter receives these outputs then inserts the summarized content. The intermediate outputs are observable, making the style generation easy to control. Our system is comprehensively evaluated by both quantitative and qualitative metrics, and it achieves state-of-the-art results in SHG over three different stylistic datasets.

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/624](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/624)

**Abstract**:

Named entity recognition and relation extraction are two important core subtasks of information extraction, which aim to identify named entities and extract relations between them. In recent years, span representation methods have received a lot of attention and are widely used to extract entities and corresponding relations from plain texts. Most recent works focus on how to obtain better span representations from pre-trained encoders, but ignore the negative impact of a large number of span candidates on slowing down the model performance. In our work, we propose a joint entity and relation extraction model with an attention mechanism and position-attentive markers. The attention score of each candidate span is calculated, and most of the candidate spans with low attention scores are pruned before being fed into the span classifier, thus achieving the goal of removing the most irrelevant spans. At the same time, in order to explore whether the position information can improve the performance of the model, we add position-attentive markers to the model. The experimental results show that our model is effective. With the same pre-trained encoder, our model achieves the new state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks (ACE05, CoNLL04 and SciERC), obtaining a 4.7%-17.8% absolute improvement in relation F1.

## [624] EditSinger: Zero-Shot Text-Based Singing Voice Editing System with Diverse Prosody Modeling

**Authors**: *Lichao Zhang, Zhou Zhao, Yi Ren, Liqun Deng*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/625](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/625)

**Abstract**:

Zero-shot text-based singing editing enables singing voice modification based on the given edited lyrics without any additional data from the target singer. However, due to the different demands, challenges occur when applying existing speech editing methods to singing voice editing task, mainly including the lack of systematic consideration concerning prosody in insertion and deletion, as well as the trade-off between the naturalness of pronunciation and the preservation of prosody in replacement. In this paper we propose EditSinger, which is a novel singing voice editing model with specially designed diverse prosody modules to overcome the challenges above. Specifically, 1) a general masked variance adaptor is introduced for the comprehensive prosody modeling of the inserted lyrics and the transition of deletion boundary; and 2) we further design a fusion pitch predictor for replacement. By disentangling the reference pitch and fusing the predicted pronunciation, the edited pitch can be reconstructed, which could ensure a natural pronunciation while preserving the prosody of the original audio. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first zero-shot text-based singing voice editing system. Our experiments conducted on the OpenSinger prove that EditSinger can synthesize high-quality edited singing voices with natural prosody according to the corresponding operations.

## [625] "Think Before You Speak": Improving Multi-Action Dialog Policy by Planning Single-Action Dialogs

**Authors**: *Shuo Zhang, Junzhou Zhao, Pinghui Wang, Yu Li, Yi Huang, Junlan Feng*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/626](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/626)

**Abstract**:

Multi-action dialog policy (MADP), which generates multiple atomic dialog actions per turn, has been widely applied in task-oriented dialog systems to provide expressive and efficient system responses. Existing MADP models usually imitate action combinations from the labeled multi-action dialog samples. Due to data limitations, they generalize poorly toward unseen dialog flows. While interactive learning and reinforcement learning algorithms can be applied to incorporate external data sources of real users and user simulators, they take significant manual effort to build and suffer from instability. To address these issues, we propose Planning Enhanced Dialog Policy (PEDP), a novel multi-task learning framework that learns single-action dialog dynamics to enhance multi-action prediction. Our PEDP method employs model-based planning for conceiving what to express before deciding the current response through simulating single-action dialogs. Experimental results on the MultiWOZ dataset demonstrate that our fully supervised learning-based method achieves a solid task success rate of 90.6%, improving 3% compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The source code and the appendix of this paper can be obtained from https://github.com/ShuoZhangXJTU/PEDP.

## [626] Charge Prediction by Constitutive Elements Matching of Crimes

**Authors**: *Jie Zhao, Ziyu Guan, Cai Xu, Wei Zhao, Enze Chen*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/627](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/627)

**Abstract**:

Charge prediction is to automatically predict the judgemental charges for legal cases. To convict a person/unit of a charge, the case description must contain matching instances of the constitutive elements (CEs) of that charge. This knowledge of CEs is a valuable guide for the judge in making final decisions. However, it is far from fully exploited for charge prediction in the literature. In this paper we propose a novel method named Constitutive Elements-guided Charge Prediction (CECP). CECP mimics human's charge identification process to extract potential instances of CEs and generate predictions accordingly. It avoids laborious labeling of matching instances of CEs by a novel reinforcement learning module which progressively selects potentially matching sentences for CEs and evaluates their relevance. The final prediction is generated based on the selected sentences and their relevant CEs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the superiority of CECP over competitive baselines.

## [627] CauAIN: Causal Aware Interaction Network for Emotion Recognition in Conversations

**Authors**: *Weixiang Zhao, Yanyan Zhao, Xin Lu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/628](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/628)

**Abstract**:

Emotion Recognition in Conversations has attained increasing interest in the natural language processing community. Many neural-network based approaches endeavor to solve the challenge of emotional dynamics in conversations and gain appealing results. However, these works are limited in capturing deep emotional clues in conversational context because they ignore the emotion cause that could be viewed as stimulus to the target emotion. In this work, we propose Causal Aware Interaction Network (CauAIN) to thoroughly understand the conversational context with the help of emotion cause detection. Specifically, we retrieve causal clues provided by commonsense knowledge to guide the process of causal utterance traceback. Both retrieve and traceback steps are performed from the perspective of intra- and inter-speaker interaction simultaneously. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our model achieves better performance over most baseline models.

## [628] Reasoning over Hybrid Chain for Table-and-Text Open Domain Question Answering

**Authors**: *Wanjun Zhong, Junjie Huang, Qian Liu, Ming Zhou, Jiahai Wang, Jian Yin, Nan Duan*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/629](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/629)

**Abstract**:

Tabular and textual question answering requires systems to perform reasoning over heterogeneous information, considering table structure, and the connections among table and text. In this paper, we propose a ChAin-centric Reasoning and Pre-training framework (CARP). CARP utilizes hybrid chain to model the explicit intermediate reasoning process across table and text for question answering. We also propose a novel chain-centric pre-training method, to enhance the pre-trained model in identifying the cross-modality reasoning process and alleviating the data sparsity problem. This method constructs the large-scale reasoning corpus by synthesizing pseudo heterogeneous reasoning paths from Wikipedia and generating corresponding questions. We evaluate our system on OTT-QA, a large-scale table-and-text open-domain question answering benchmark, and our system achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Further analyses illustrate that the explicit hybrid chain offers substantial performance improvement and interpretablity of the intermediate reasoning process, and the chain-centric pre-training boosts the performance on the chain extraction.

## [629] None Class Ranking Loss for Document-Level Relation Extraction

**Authors**: *Yang Zhou, Wee Sun Lee*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/630](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/630)

**Abstract**:

Document-level relation extraction (RE) aims at extracting relations among entities expressed across multiple sentences, which can be viewed as a multi-label classification problem. In a typical document, most entity pairs do not express any pre-defined relation and are labeled as "none" or "no relation". For good document-level RE performance, it is crucial to distinguish such none class instances (entity pairs) from those of pre-defined classes (relations). However, most existing methods only estimate the probability of pre-defined relations independently without considering the probability of "no relation". This ignores the context of entity pairs and the label correlations between the none class and pre-defined classes, leading to sub-optimal predictions. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-label loss that encourages large margins of label confidence scores between each pre-defined class and the none class, which enables captured label correlations and context-dependent thresholding for label prediction. To gain further robustness against positive-negative imbalance and mislabeled data that could appear in real-world RE datasets, we propose a margin regularization and a margin shifting technique. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing multi-label losses for document-level RE and works well in other multi-label tasks such as emotion classification when none class instances are available for training.

## [630] Grape: Grammar-Preserving Rule Embedding

**Authors**: *Qihao Zhu, Zeyu Sun, Wenjie Zhang, Yingfei Xiong, Lu Zhang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/631](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/631)

**Abstract**:

Word embedding has been widely used in various areas to boost the performance of the neural models. However, when processing context-free languages, embedding grammar rules with word embedding loses two types of information. One is the structural relationship between the grammar rules, and the other one is the content information of the rule definition.
In this paper, we make the first attempt to learn a grammar-preserving rule embedding. We first introduce a novel graph structure to represent the context-free grammar. Then, we apply a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to extract the structural information and use a gating layer to integrate content information. 
We conducted experiments on six widely-used benchmarks containing four context-free languages. The results show that our approach improves the accuracy of the base model by 0.8 to 6.4 percentage points. Furthermore, Grape also achieves 1.6 F1 score improvement on the method naming task which shows the generality of our approach.

## [631] Efficient Document-level Event Extraction via Pseudo-Trigger-aware Pruned Complete Graph

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/632](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/632)

**Abstract**:

Most previous studies of document-level event extraction mainly focus on building argument chains in an autoregressive way, which achieves a certain success but is inefficient in both training and inference.
In contrast to the previous studies, we propose a fast and lightweight model named as PTPCG.
In our model, we design a novel strategy for event argument combination together with a non-autoregressive decoding algorithm via pruned complete graphs, which are constructed under the guidance of the automatically selected pseudo triggers.
Compared to the previous systems, our system achieves competitive results with 19.8% of parameters and much lower resource consumption, taking only 3.8% GPU hours for training and up to 8.5 times faster for inference.
Besides, our model shows superior compatibility for the datasets with (or without) triggers and the pseudo triggers can be the supplements for annotated triggers to make further improvements.

## [632] Contrastive Graph Transformer Network for Personality Detection

**Authors**: *Yangfu Zhu, Linmei Hu, Xinkai Ge, Wanrong Peng, Bin Wu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/633](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/633)

**Abstract**:

Personality detection is to identify the personality traits underlying social media posts. Most of the existing work is mainly devoted to learning the representations of posts based on labeled data. Yet the ground-truth personality traits are collected through time-consuming questionnaires. Thus, one of the biggest limitations lies in the lack of training data for this data-hungry task. In addition, the correlations among traits should be considered since they are important psychological cues that could help collectively identify the traits. In this paper, we construct a fully-connected post graph for each user and develop a novel Contrastive Graph Transformer Network model (CGTN) which distills potential labels of the graphs based on both labeled and unlabeled data. Specifically, our model first explores a self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) to learn the post embeddings. We design two types of post graph augmentations to incorporate different priors based on psycholinguistic knowledge of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and post semantics. Then, upon the post embeddings of the graph, a Transformer-based decoder equipped with post-to-trait attention is exploited to generate traits sequentially. Experiments on two standard datasets demonstrate that our CGTN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for personality detection.

## [633] Explaining the Behaviour of Hybrid Systems with PDDL+ Planning

**Authors**: *Diego Aineto, Eva Onaindia, Miquel Ramírez, Enrico Scala, Ivan Serina*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/634](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/634)

**Abstract**:

The aim of this work is to explain the observed behaviour of a hybrid system (HS). The explanation problem is cast as finding a trajectory of the HS that matches some observations. By using the formalism of hybrid automata (HA), we characterize the explanations as the language of a network of HA that comprises one automaton for the HS and another one for the observations, thus restricting the behaviour of the HS exclusively to trajectories that explain the observations. We observe that this problem corresponds to a reachability problem in model-checking, but that state-of-the-art model checkers struggle to find concrete trajectories. To overcome this issue we provide a formal mapping from HA to PDDL+ and show how to use an off-the-shelf automated planner. An experimental analysis over domains with piece-wise constant, linear and nonlinear dynamics reveals that the proposed PDDL+ approach is much more efficient than solving directly the explanation problem with model-checking solvers.

## [634] Online Bin Packing with Predictions

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/635](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/635)

**Abstract**:

Bin packing is a classic optimization problem with a wide range of applications from load balancing to supply chain management. In this work, we study the online variant of the problem, in which a sequence of items of various sizes must be placed into a minimum number of bins of uniform capacity. The online algorithm is enhanced with a (potentially erroneous) prediction concerning the frequency of item sizes in the sequence. We design and analyze online algorithms with efficient tradeoffs between the consistency (i.e., the competitive ratio assuming no prediction error) and the robustness (i.e., the competitive ratio under adversarial error), and whose performance degrades near-optimally as a function of the prediction error. This is the first theoretical and experimental study of online bin packing in the realistic setting of learnable predictions. Previous work addressed only extreme cases with respect to the prediction error, and relied on overly powerful and error-free oracles.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/636](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/636)

**Abstract**:

Using machine-learned predictions to create algorithms with better approximation guarantees is a very fresh and active field. In this work, we study classic scheduling problems under the learning augmented setting. More specifically, we consider the problem of scheduling jobs with arbitrary release dates on a single machine and the problem of scheduling jobs with a common release date on multiple machines. Our objective is to minimize the sum of completion times. For both problems, we propose algorithms which use predictions for taking their decisions. Our algorithms are consistent -- i.e. when the predictions are accurate, the performances of our algorithms are close to those of an  optimal offline algorithm--, and robust -- i.e.  when the predictions are wrong, the performance of our algorithms are close to those of an online algorithm without predictions. In addition, we confirm the above theoretical bounds by conducting experimental evaluation comparing the proposed algorithms to the offline optimal ones for both the single and multiple machines settings.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/637](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/637)

**Abstract**:

Reasoning about uncertainty is vital in many real-life autonomous systems. However, current state-of-the-art planning algorithms either cannot reason about uncertainty explicitly, or do so with high computational burden. Here, we focus on making informed decisions efficiently, using reward functions that explicitly deal with uncertainty. We formulate an approximation, namely an abstract observation model, that uses an aggregation scheme to alleviate computational costs. We derive bounds on the expected information-theoretic reward function and, as a consequence, on the value function. We then propose a method to refine aggregation to achieve identical action selection in a fraction of the computational time.

## [637] Tight Bounds for Hybrid Planning

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/638](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/638)

**Abstract**:

Several hierarchical planning systems feature a rich level of language features making them capable of expressing real-world problems. One such feature that's used by several current planning systems is causal links, which are used to track search progress. The formalism combining Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning with these links known from Partial Order Causal Link (POCL) planning is often referred to as hybrid planning. In this paper we study the computational complexity of such hybrid planning problems. More specifically, we provide missing membership results to existing hardness proofs and thereby provide tight complexity bounds for all known subclasses of hierarchical planning problems. We also re-visit and correct a result from the literature for plan verification showing that it remains NP-complete even in the absence of a task hierarchy.

## [638] Planning with Qualitative Action-Trajectory Constraints in PDDL

**Authors**: *Luigi Bonassi, Alfonso Emilio Gerevini, Enrico Scala*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/639](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/639)

**Abstract**:

In automated planning the ability of expressing constraints on the structure of the desired plans is important to deal with solution quality, as well as to express control knowledge. In PDDL3, this is supported through state-trajectory constraints corresponding to a class of LTLf formulae. In this paper,  first we introduce a formalism to express trajectory constraints over actions in the plan, rather than over traversed states; Then we investigate compilation-based methods to deal with such constraints in propositional planning, and propose a new simple effective method. Finally, we experimentally study the usefulness of our action-trajectory constraints as a tool to express control knowledge. The experimental results show that the performance of a classical planner can be significantly improved by exploiting knowledge expressed by action constraints and handled by our compilation method, while the same knowledge turns out to be less beneficial when specified as state constraints and handled by two state-of-the-art systems supporting state constraints.

## [639] Shared Autonomy Systems with Stochastic Operator Models

**Authors**: *Clarissa Costen, Marc Rigter, Bruno Lacerda, Nick Hawes*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/640](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/640)

**Abstract**:

We consider shared autonomy systems where multiple operators (AI and human), can interact with the environment, e.g. by controlling a robot. The decision problem for the shared autonomy system is to select which operator takes control at each timestep, such that a reward specifying the intended system behaviour is maximised. The performance of the human operator is influenced by unobserved factors, such as fatigue or skill level. Therefore, the system must reason over stochastic models of operator performance. We present a framework for stochastic operators in shared autonomy systems (SO-SAS), where we represent operators using rich, partially observable models. We formalise SO-SAS as a mixed-observability Markov decision process, where environment states are fully observable and internal operator states are hidden. We test SO-SAS on a simulated domain and a computer game, empirically showing it results in better performance compared to traditional formulations of shared autonomy systems.

## [640] Explaining Soft-Goal Conflicts through Constraint Relaxations

**Authors**: *Rebecca Eifler, Jeremy Frank, Jörg Hoffmann*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/641](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/641)

**Abstract**:

Recent work suggests to explain trade-offs between soft-goals in terms of their conflicts, i.e., minimal unsolvable soft-goal subsets. But this does not explain the conflicts themselves: Why can a given set of soft-goals not be jointly achieved? Here we approach that question in terms of the underlying constraints on plans in the task at hand, namely resource availability and time windows. In this context, a natural form of explanation for a soft-goal conflict is a minimal constraint relaxation under which the conflict disappears (``if the deadline was 1 hour later, it would work''). We explore algorithms for computing such explanations. A baseline is to simply loop over all relaxed tasks and compute the conflicts for each separately. We improve over this by two algorithms that leverage information -- conflicts, reachable states -- across relaxed tasks. We show that these algorithms can exponentially outperform the baseline in theory, and we run experiments confirming that advantage in practice.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/642](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/642)

**Abstract**:

How  can  we  plan  efficiently  in  a  large  and  complex environment when the time budget is limited? Given  the  original  simulator  of  the  environment, which may be computationally very demanding, we propose to learn online an approximate but much faster simulator that improves over time.  To plan reliably and efficiently while the approximate simulator is learning, we develop a method that adaptively decides which simulator to use for every simulation, based on a statistic that measures the accuracy of the approximate simulator. This allows us to use the approximate simulator to replace the original simulator for faster simulations when it is accurate enough under the current context, thus trading off  simulation speed  and  accuracy.   Experimental results in two large domains show that when integrated with POMCP, our approach allows to plan with improving efficiency over time.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/643](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/643)

**Abstract**:

Long range space missions, such as Rosetta, require robust plans of data-acquisition activities and of the resulting data transfers. In this paper we revisit the problem of assigning priorities to data transfers in order to maximize safety margin of onboard memory. We propose a fast sweep algorithm to verify the feasibility of a given priority assignment and we introduce an efficient exact algorithm to assign priorities on a single downlink window. We prove that the problem is NP-hard for several windows, and we propose several randomized heuristics to tackle the general case. Our experimental results show that  the proposed approaches are able to  improve the plans computed for the real mission by the previously existing method, while the sweep algorithm yields drastic accelerations.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/645](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/645)

**Abstract**:

This paper studies a novel planning problem for multiple agents that cannot share holding resources, named OTIMAPP (Offline Time-Independent Multi-Agent Path Planning). Given a graph and a set of start-goal pairs, the problem consists in assigning a path to each agent such that every agent eventually reaches their goal without blocking each other, regardless of how the agents are being scheduled at runtime. The motivation stems from the nature of distributed environments that agents take actions fully asynchronous and have no knowledge about those exact timings of other actors. We present solution conditions, computational complexity, solvers, and robotic applications.

**Abstract**:

Model-reconciliation explanation is a popular framework for generating explanations for planning problems. While the framework has been extended to multiple settings since its introduction for classical planning problems, there is little agreement on the computational complexity of generating minimal model reconciliation explanations in the basic setting. In this paper, we address this lacuna by introducing a decision-version of the model-reconciliation explanation generation problem
and we show that it is Sigma-2-P Complete.

## [646] Landmark Heuristics for Lifted Classical Planning

**Authors**: *Julia Wichlacz, Daniel Höller, Jörg Hoffmann*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/647](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/647)

**Abstract**:

While state-of-the-art planning systems need a grounded (propositional) task representation, the input model is provided "lifted", specifying predicates and action schemas with variables over a finite object universe. The size of the grounded model is exponential in predicate/action-schema arity, limiting applicability to cases where it is small enough. Recent work has taken up this challenge, devising an effective lifted forward search planner as basis for lifted heuristic search, as well as a variety of lifted heuristic functions based on the delete relaxation. Here we add a novel family of lifted heuristic functions, based on landmarks. We design two methods for landmark extraction in the lifted setting. The resulting heuristics exhibit performance advantages over previous heuristics in several benchmark domains. Especially the combination with lifted delete relaxation heuristics to a LAMA-style planner yields good results, beating the previous state of the art in lifted planning.

## [647] Competitive Analysis for Multi-Commodity Ski-Rental Problem

**Authors**: *Binghan Wu, Wei Bao, Dong Yuan, Bing Zhou*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/648](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/648)

**Abstract**:

We investigate an extended version of the classical ski-rental problem with multiple commodities. A customer uses a set of commodities altogether, and he/she needs to choose payment options to cover the usage of each commodity without the knowledge of the future. The payment options of each commodity include (1) renting: to pay for an on-demand usage and (2) buying: to pay for the lifetime usage. It is a novel extension of the classical ski-rental problem which deals with only one commodity. To address this problem, we propose a new online algorithm called the Multi-Object Break-Even (MOBE) algorithm and conduct competitive analysis. We show that the tight lower and upper bounds of MOBE algorithm's competitive ratio are e/e-1 and 2 respectively against adaptive adversary under arbitrary renting and buying prices. We further prove that MOBE algorithm is an optimal online algorithm if commodities have the same rent-to-buy ratio. Numerical results verify our theoretical conclusion and demonstrate the advantages of MOBE in a real-world scenario.

## [648] An Online Learning Approach towards Far-sighted Emergency Relief Planning under Intentional Attacks in Conflict Areas

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/649](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/649)

**Abstract**:

A large number of emergency humanitarian rescue demands in conflict areas around the world are accompanied by intentional, persistent and unpredictable attacks on rescuers and supplies. Unfortunately, existing work on humanitarian relief planning mostly ignores this challenge in reality resulting a parlous and short-sighted relief distribution plan to a large extent. To address this, we first propose an offline multi-stage optimization problem of emergency relief planning under intentional attacks, in which all parameters in the game between the rescuer and attacker are supposed to be known or predictable. Then, an online version of this problem is introduced to meet the need of online and irrevocable decision making when those parameters are revealed in an online fashion. To achieve a far-sighted emergency relief planning under attacks, we design an online learning approach which is proven to obtain a near-optimal solution of the offline problem when those online reveled parameters are i.i.d. sampled from an unknown distribution. Finally, extensive experiments on a real anti-Ebola relief planning case based on the data of Ebola outbreak and armed attacks in DRC Congo show the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

## [649] PG3: Policy-Guided Planning for Generalized Policy Generation

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/650](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/650)

**Abstract**:

A longstanding objective in classical planning is to synthesize policies that generalize across multiple problems from the same domain. In this work, we study generalized policy search-based methods with a focus on the score function used to guide the search over policies. We demonstrate limitations of two score functions --- policy evaluation and plan comparison --- and propose a new approach that overcomes these limitations. The main idea behind our approach, Policy-Guided Planning for Generalized Policy Generalization (PG3), is that a candidate policy should be used to guide planning on training problems as a mechanism for evaluating that candidate. Theoretical results in a simplified setting give conditions under which PG3 is optimal or admissible. We then study a specific instantiation of policy search where planning problems are PDDL-based and policies are lifted decision lists. Empirical results in six domains confirm that PG3 learns generalized policies more efficiently and effectively than several baselines.

## [650] A Native Qualitative Numeric Planning Solver Based on AND/OR Graph Search

**Authors**: *Hemeng Zeng, Yikun Liang, Yongmei Liu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/651](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/651)

**Abstract**:

Qualitative numeric planning (QNP) is classical planning extended with non-negative real variables that can be increased or decreased by some arbitrary amount. Existing approaches for solving QNP problems are exclusively based on compilation to fully observable nondeterministic planning (FOND) problems or FOND+ problems, i.e., FOND problems with explicit fairness assumptions. However, the FOND-compilation approaches suffer from some limitations, such as difficulties to generate all strong cyclic solutions for FOND problems or introducing a great many extra variables and actions. In this paper, we propose a simpler characterization of QNP solutions and a new approach to solve QNP problems based on directly searching for a solution, which is a closed and terminating subgraph that contains a goal node, in the AND/OR graphs induced by QNP problems. Moreover, we introduce a pruning strategy based on termination tests on subgraphs. We implemented a native solver DSET based on the proposed approach and compared the performance of it with that of the two compilation-based approaches. Experimental results show that DSET is faster than the FOND-compilation approach by one order of magnitude, and comparable with the FOND+-compilation approach.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/652](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/652)

**Abstract**:

A major challenge for ridesharing platforms is to guarantee profit and fairness simultaneously, especially in the presence of misaligned incentives of drivers and riders. We focus on the  dispatching-pricing problem to maximize the total revenue while keeping both drivers and riders satisfied. We study the computational complexity of the problem, provide a novel two-phased pricing solution with revenue and fairness guarantees, extend it to stochastic settings and develop a dynamic (a.k.a., learning-while-doing) algorithm that actively collects data to learn the demand distribution during the scheduling process. We also conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.

## [652] Multi-robot Task Allocation in the Environment with Functional Tasks

**Authors**: *Fuhan Yan, Kai Di*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/653](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/653)

**Abstract**:

Multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problem has long been a key issue in multi-robot systems. Previous studies usually assumed that the robots must complete all tasks with minimum time cost. However, in many real situations, some tasks can be selectively performed by robots and will not limit the achievement of the goal. Instead, completing these tasks will cause some functional effects, such as decreasing the time cost of completing other tasks. This kind of task can be called “functional task”. This paper studies the multi-robot task allocation in the environment with functional tasks. In the problem, neither allocating all functional tasks nor allocating no functional task is always optimal. Previous algorithms usually allocate all tasks and cannot suitably select the functional tasks. Because of the interaction and sequential influence, the total effects of the functional tasks are too complex to exactly calculate. We fully analyze this problem and then design a heuristic algorithm. The heuristic algorithm scores the functional tasks referring to linear threshold model (used to analyze the sequential influence of a functional task). The simulated experiments demonstrate that the heuristic algorithm can outperform the benchmark algorithms.

## [653] A Closed-Loop Perception, Decision-Making and Reasoning Mechanism for Human-Like Navigation

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/654](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/654)

**Abstract**:

Reliable navigation systems have a wide range of applications in robotics and autonomous driving. Current approaches employ an open-loop process that converts sensor inputs directly into actions. However, these open-loop schemes are challenging to handle complex and dynamic real-world scenarios due to their poor generalization. Imitating human navigation, we add a reasoning process to convert actions back to internal latent states, forming a two-stage closed loop of perception, decision-making, and reasoning. Firstly, VAE-Enhanced Demonstration Learning endows the model with the understanding of basic navigation rules. Then, two dual processes in RL-Enhanced Interaction Learning generate reward feedback for each other and collectively enhance obstacle avoidance capability. The reasoning model can substantially promote generalization and robustness, and facilitate the deployment of the algorithm to real-world robots without elaborate transfers. Experiments show our method is more adaptable to novel scenarios compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

## [654] Robust Subset Selection by Greedy and Evolutionary Pareto Optimization

**Authors**: *Chao Bian, Yawen Zhou, Chao Qian*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/655](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/655)

**Abstract**:

Subset selection, which aims to select a subset from a ground set to maximize some objective function, arises in various applications such as influence maximization and sensor placement. In real-world scenarios, however, one often needs to find a subset which is robust against (i.e., is good over) a number of possible objective functions due to uncertainty, resulting in the problem of robust subset selection. This paper considers robust subset selection with monotone objective functions, relaxing the submodular property required by previous studies. We first show that the greedy algorithm can obtain an approximation ratio with respect to the correlation and submodularity ratios of the objective functions; and then propose EPORSS, an evolutionary Pareto optimization algorithm that can utilize more time to find better subsets. We prove that EPORSS can also be theoretically grounded, achieving a similar approximation guarantee to the greedy algorithm. In addition, we derive the lower bound of the correlation ratio for the application of robust influence maximization, and further conduct experiments to validate the performance of the greedy algorithm and EPORSS.

## [655] Budgeted Sequence Submodular Maximization

**Authors**: *Xuefeng Chen, Liang Feng, Xin Cao, Yifeng Zeng, Yaqing Hou*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/656](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/656)

**Abstract**:

The problem of selecting a sequence of items that maximizes a given submodular function appears in many real-world applications. Existing study on the problem only considers uniform costs over items, but non-uniform costs on items are more general. Taking this cue, we study the problem of budgeted sequence submodular maximization (BSSM), which introduces non-uniform costs of items into the sequence selection. This problem can be found in a number of  applications such as movie recommendation, course sequence design and so on. Non-uniform costs on items significantly increase the solution complexity and we prove that BSSM is NP-hard. To solve the problem, we first propose a greedy algorithm GBM with an error bound. We also design an anytime algorithm POBM based on Pareto optimization to improve the quality of solutions. Moreover, we prove that POBM can obtain approximate solutions in expected polynomial running time, and converges faster than a state-of-the-art algorithm POSEQSEL for sequence submodular maximization with cardinality constraints. We further introduce optimizations to speed up POBM. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the performance of our new algorithms.

## [656] Learning and Exploiting Progress States in Greedy Best-First Search

**Authors**: *Patrick Ferber, Liat Cohen, Jendrik Seipp, Thomas Keller*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/657](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/657)

**Abstract**:

Previous work introduced the concept of progress
states. After expanding a progress state, a greedy
best-first search (GBFS) will only expand states
with lower heuristic values. Current methods can
identify progress states only for a single task and
only after a solution for the task has been found.
We introduce a novel approach that learns a description
logic formula characterizing all progress
states in a classical planning domain. Using the
learned formulas in a GBFS to break ties in favor
of progress states often significantly reduces the
search effort.

## [657] Completeness and Diversity in Depth-First Proof-Number Search with Applications to Retrosynthesis

**Authors**: *Christopher Franz, Georg Mogk, Thomas Mrziglod, Kevin Schewior*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/658](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/658)

**Abstract**:

We revisit Depth-First Proof-Number Search (DFPN), a well-known algorithm for solving two-player games. First, we consider the completeness property of the algorithm and its variants, i.e., whether they always find a winning strategy when there exists one. While it is known that the standard version is not complete, we show that the combination with the simple Threshold Controlling Algorithm is complete, solving an open problem from the area. Second, we modify DFPN to compute a diverse set of solutions rather than just a single one. Finally, we apply this new variant in Chemistry to the synthesis planning of new target molecules (Retrosynthesis). In this domain a diverse set of many solutions is desirable. We apply additional modifications from the literature to the algorithm and show that it outperforms Monte-Carlo Tree-Search, another well-known algorithm for the same problem, according to a natural diversity measure.

## [658] Large Neighborhood Search with Decision Diagrams

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/659](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/659)

**Abstract**:

Local search is a popular technique to solve combinatorial
optimization problems efficiently. To escape local minima one generally uses
metaheuristics or try to design large neighborhoods around the current best
solution. A somewhat more black box approach consists in using an
optimization solver to explore a large neighborhood. This is the
large-neighborhood search (LNS) idea that we reuse in this work. We
introduce a generic neighborhood exploration algorithm based on restricted
decision diagrams (DD) constructed from the current best
solution. We experiment DD-LNS on two sequencing problems: the
traveling salesman problem with time windows (TSPTW) and a production
planning problem (DLSP). Despite its simplicity, DD-LNS is competitive with
the state-of-the-art MIP approach on DLSP. It is able to improve the
best known solutions of some standard instances for TSPTW and even to prove 
the optimality of quite a few other instances.

## [659] Efficient Budgeted Graph Search

**Authors**: *Jasmeet Kaur, Nathan R. Sturtevant*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/660](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/660)

**Abstract**:

Iterative Budgeted Exponential Search (IBEX) is a general search algorithm that can limit the number of re-expansions performed in common problems like iterative-deepening tree search and search with inconsistent heuristics. IBEX has been adapted into a specific tree algorithm, Budgeted Tree Search (BTS), which behaves like IDA* when the problem instance is well-behaved but keeps the worst-case guarantees when problems are not well-behaved. The analogous algorithms on graphs, Budgeted Graph Search (BGS), do not have these same properties. This paper reformulates BGS into Efficient Budgeted Graph Search (BGSe), showing how to implement the algorithm so that it behaves identically to A* when problems are well-behaved, and retains the best-case performance otherwise. Experimental results validate the performance of BGSe on a range of theoretical and practical problem instances.

## [660] Generalisation of Alpha-Beta Search for AND-OR Graphs With Partially Ordered Values

**Authors**: *Junkang Li, Bruno Zanuttini, Tristan Cazenave, Véronique Ventos*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/661](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/661)

**Abstract**:

We define a new setting related to the evaluation of AND-OR directed acyclic graphs with partially ordered values. Such graphs arise naturally when solving games with incomplete information (e.g. most card games such as Bridge) or games with multiple criteria. In particular, this setting generalises standard AND-OR graph evaluation and computation of optimal strategies in games with complete information.

Under this setting, we propose a new algorithm which uses both alpha-beta pruning and cached values. In this paper, we present our algorithm, prove its correctness, and give experimental results on a card game with incomplete information.

## [661] Efficient Neural Neighborhood Search for Pickup and Delivery Problems

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/662](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/662)

**Abstract**:

We present an efficient Neural Neighborhood Search (N2S) approach for pickup and delivery problems (PDPs). In specific, we design a powerful Synthesis Attention that allows the vanilla self-attention to synthesize various types of features regarding a route solution. We also exploit two customized decoders that automatically learn to perform removal and reinsertion of a pickup-delivery node pair to tackle the precedence constraint. Additionally, a diversity enhancement scheme is leveraged to further ameliorate the performance. Our N2S is generic, and extensive experiments on two canonical PDP variants show that it can produce state-of-the-art results among existing neural methods. Moreover, it even outstrips the well-known LKH3 solver on the more constrained PDP variant. Our implementation for N2S is available online.

## [662] Real-Time Heuristic Search with LTLf Goals

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/663](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/663)

**Abstract**:

In Real-Time Heuristic Search (RTHS) we are given a search graph G, a heuristic, and the objective is to find a path from a given start node to a given goal node in G. As such, one does not impose any trajectory constraints on the path, besides reaching the goal. In this paper we consider a version of RTHS in which temporally extended goals can be defined on the form of the path. Such goals are specified in Linear Temporal Logic over Finite Traces (LTLf), an expressive language that has been considered in many other frameworks, such as Automated Planning, Synthesis, and Reinforcement Learning, but has not yet been studied in the context of RTHS. We propose a general automata-theoretic approach for RTHS, whereby LTLf goals are supported as the result of searching over the cross product of the search graph and the automaton for the LTLf goal; specifically, we describe LTL-LRTA*, a version of LSS-LRTA*. Second, we propose an approach to produce heuristics for LTLf goals, based on existing goal-dependent heuristics. Finally, we propose a greedy strategy for RTHS with LTLf goals, which focuses search to make progress over the structure of the automaton; this yields LTL-LRTA*+A. In our experimental evaluation over standard benchmarks we show LTL-LRTA*+A may outperform LTL-LRTA* substantially for a variety of LTLf goals.

We provide a detailed analysis and evaluation of the algorithm components, including different ways to represent the hyper-heuristic state space and reset strategies to avoid unpromising areas of the solution space.
Our methods have been evaluated using HyFlex, a well-known benchmarking framework for cross-domain hyper-heuristics, and compared with state-of-the-art approaches.
The experimental evaluation shows that our reinforcement-learning based approach produces results that are competitive with the state-of-the-art, including the top participants of the Cross Domain Hyper-heuristic Search Competition 2011.

## [664] Runtime Analysis of Single- and Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms for Chance Constrained Optimization Problems with Normally Distributed Random Variables

**Authors**: *Frank Neumann, Carsten Witt*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/665](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/665)

**Abstract**:

Chance constrained optimization problems allow to model problems where constraints involving stochastic components should only be violated with a small probability. Evolutionary algorithms have been applied to this scenario and shown to achieve high quality results. With this paper, we contribute to the theoretical understanding of evolutionary algorithms for chance constrained optimization. We study the scenario of stochastic components that are independent and Normally distributed.
Considering the simple single-objective (1+1)~EA, we show that imposing an additional uniform constraint already leads to local optima for very restricted scenarios and an exponential optimization time. We therefore introduce a multi-objective formulation of the problem which trades off the expected cost and its variance. We show that multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are highly effective when using this formulation and obtain a set of solutions that contains an optimal solution for any possible confidence level imposed on the constraint. Furthermore, we prove that this approach can also be used to compute a set of optimal solutions for the chance constrained minimum spanning tree problem. Experimental investigations on instances of the NP-hard stochastic minimum weight dominating set problem  confirm the benefit of the multi-objective approach in practice.

In this work, we study the problem of monotone non-submodular maximization with partition matroid constraint. Although a generalization of this problem has been studied in literature, our work focuses on leveraging properties of partition matroid constraint to (1) propose algorithms with theoretical bound and efficient query complexity; and (2) provide better analysis on theoretical performance guarantee of some existing techniques. We further investigate those algorithms' performance in two applications: Boosting Influence Spread and Video Summarization. Experiments show our algorithms return comparative results to the state-of-the-art algorithms while taking much fewer queries.

## [666] Neural Network Pruning by Cooperative Coevolution

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/667](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/667)

**Abstract**:

Neural network pruning is a popular model compression method which can significantly reduce the computing cost with negligible loss of accuracy. Recently, filters are often pruned directly by designing proper criteria or using auxiliary modules to measure their importance, which, however, requires expertise and trial-and-error. Due to the advantage of automation, pruning by evolutionary algorithms (EAs) has attracted much attention, but the performance is limited for deep neural networks as the search space can be quite large. In this paper, we propose a new filter pruning algorithm CCEP by cooperative coevolution, which prunes the filters in each layer by EAs separately. That is, CCEP reduces the pruning space by a divide-and-conquer strategy. The experiments show that CCEP can achieve a competitive performance with the state-of-the-art pruning methods, e.g., prune ResNet56 for 63.42% FLOPs on CIFAR10 with -0.24% accuracy drop, and ResNet50 for 44.56% FLOPs on ImageNet with 0.07% accuracy drop.

**Abstract**:

The diversified top-k weight clique (DTKWC) search problem is an important generalization of the diversified top-k clique (DTKC) search problem with extensive applications, which extends the DTKC search problem by taking into account the weight of vertices. In this paper, we formulate DTKWC search problem using mixed integer linear program constraints and propose an efficient hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA-D) that combines a clique-based crossover operator and an effective simulated annealing-based local optimization procedure to find high-quality local optima. The experimental results show that HEA-D performs much better than the existing methods on two representative real-world benchmarks.

## [668] A Weighting-Based Tabu Search Algorithm for the p-Next Center Problem

**Authors**: *Qingyun Zhang, Zhouxing Su, Zhipeng Lü, Lingxiao Yang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/669](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/669)

**Abstract**:

The p-next center problem (pNCP) is an extension of the classical p-center problem. It consists of locating p centers from a set of candidate centers and allocating both a reference and a backup center to each client, to minimize the maximum cost, which is the length of the path from a client to its reference center and then to its backup center. Among them, the reference center is the closest center to a client and serves it under normal circumstances, while the backup center is the closest center to the reference center and serves the client when the reference center is out of service. In this paper, we propose a weighting-based tabu search algorithm called WTS for solving pNCP. WTS optimizes the pNCP by solving its decision subproblems with given assignment costs with an efficient swap-based neighborhood structure and a hierarchical penalty strategy for neighborhood evaluation. Extensive experimental studies on 413 benchmark instances demonstrate that WTS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the literature. Specifically, WTS improves 12 previous best known results and matches the optimal results for all remaining 401 ones in a much shorter time than other algorithms. More importantly, WTS reaches the lower bounds for 10 instances for the first time.

## [669] Summary Markov Models for Event Sequences

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/670](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/670)

**Abstract**:

Datasets involving sequences of different types of events without meaningful time stamps are prevalent in many applications, for instance when extracted from textual corpora. We propose a family of models for such event sequences -- summary Markov models -- where the probability of observing an event type  depends only on a summary of historical occurrences of its influencing set of event types. This Markov model family is motivated by Granger causal models for time series, with the important distinction that only one event can occur in a position in an event sequence. We show that a unique minimal influencing set exists for any set of event types of interest and choice of summary function, formulate two novel models from the general family that represent specific sequence dynamics, and propose a greedy search algorithm for learning them from event sequence data. We conduct an experimental investigation comparing the proposed models with relevant baselines, and illustrate their knowledge acquisition and discovery capabilities through case studies involving sequences from text.

## [670] Ancestral Instrument Method for Causal Inference without Complete Knowledge

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/671](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/671)

**Abstract**:

Unobserved confounding is the main obstacle to causal effect estimation from observational data. Instrumental variables (IVs) are widely used for causal effect estimation when there exist latent confounders. With the standard IV method, when a given IV is valid, unbiased estimation can be obtained, but the validity requirement on a standard IV is strict and untestable. Conditional IVs have been proposed to relax the requirement of standard IVs by conditioning on a set of observed variables (known as a conditioning set for a conditional IV). However, the criterion for finding a conditioning set for a conditional IV needs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the causal relationships of both observed and unobserved variables. This makes it challenging to discover a conditioning set directly from data. In this paper, by leveraging maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) for causal inference with latent variables, we study the graphical properties of ancestral IVs, a type of conditional IVs using MAGs, and develop the theory to support data-driven discovery of the conditioning set for a given ancestral IV in data under the pretreatment variable assumption. Based on the theory, we develop an algorithm for unbiased causal effect estimation with a given ancestral IV and observational data. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in comparison with existing IV methods.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/672](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/672)

**Abstract**:

Causal discovery is to learn cause-effect relationships among variables given observational data and is important for many applications. Existing causal discovery methods assume data sufficiency, which may not be the case in many real world datasets. As a result, many existing causal discovery methods can fail under limited data. In this work, we propose Bayesian-augmented frequentist independence tests to improve the performance of constraint-based causal discovery methods under insufficient data: 1) We firstly introduce a Bayesian method to estimate mutual information (MI), based on which we propose a robust MI based independence test; 2) Secondly, we consider the Bayesian estimation of hypothesis likelihood and incorporate it into a well-defined statistical test, resulting in a robust statistical testing based independence test. We apply proposed independence tests to constraint-based causal discovery methods and evaluate the performance on benchmark datasets with insufficient samples. Experiments show significant performance improvement in terms of both accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods.

We introduce hidden 1-counter Markov models (H1MMs) as an attractive sweet spot between standard hidden Markov models (HMMs) and probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). Both HMMs and PCFGs have a variety of applications, e.g., speech recognition, anomaly detection, and bioinformatics. PCFGs are more expressive than HMMs, e.g., they are more suited for studying protein folding or natural language processing. However, they suffer from slow parameter fitting, which is cubic in the observation sequence length. The same process for HMMs is just linear using the well-known forward-backward algorithm. We argue that by adding to each state of an HMM an integer counter, e.g., representing the number of clients waiting in a queue, brings its expressivity closer to PCFGs. At the same time, we show that parameter fitting for such a model is computationally inexpensive: it is bi-linear in the length of the observation sequence and the maximal counter value, which grows slower than the observation length. The resulting model of H1MMs allows us to combine the best of both worlds: more expressivity with faster parameter fitting.

## [673] Exchangeability-Aware Sum-Product Networks

**Authors**: *Stefan Lüdtke, Christian Bartelt, Heiner Stuckenschmidt*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/674](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/674)

**Abstract**:

Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are expressive probabilistic models that provide exact, tractable inference. They achieve this efficiency by making use of local independence. 
On the other hand, mixtures of exchangeable variable models (MEVMs) are a class of tractable probabilistic models that make use of exchangeability of discrete random variables to render inference tractable. Exchangeability, which arises naturally in relational domains, has not been considered for efficient representation and inference in SPNs yet.
The contribution of this paper is a novel probabilistic model which we call Exchangeability-Aware Sum-Product Networks (XSPNs). It contains both SPNs and MEVMs as special cases, and combines the ability of SPNs to efficiently learn deep probabilistic models with the ability of MEVMs to efficiently handle exchangeable random variables. We introduce a structure learning algorithm for XSPNs and empirically show that they can be more accurate than conventional SPNs when the data contains repeated, interchangeable parts.

## [674] Learning Cluster Causal Diagrams: An Information-Theoretic Approach

**Authors**: *Xueyan Niu, Xiaoyun Li, Ping Li*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/675](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/675)

**Abstract**:

Many real-world phenomena arise from causal relationships among a set of variables. As a powerful tool, Bayesian Network (BN) has been successful in describing high-dimensional distributions. However, the faithfulness condition, enforced in most BN learning algorithms, is violated in the settings where multiple variables synergistically affect the outcome (i.e., with polyadic dependencies). Building upon recent development in cluster causal diagrams (C-DAGs), we initiate the formal study of learning C-DAGs from observational data to relax the faithfulness condition. We propose a new scoring function, the Clustering Information Criterion (CIC), based on information-theoretic measures that represent various complex interactions among variables. The CIC score also contains a penalization of the model complexity under the minimum description length principle. We further provide a searching strategy to learn structures of high scores. Experiments on both synthetic and real data support the effectiveness of the proposed method.

## [675] Linear Combinatorial Semi-Bandit with Causally Related Rewards

**Authors**: *Behzad Nourani-Koliji, Saeed Ghoorchian, Setareh Maghsudi*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/676](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/676)

**Abstract**:

In a sequential decision-making problem, having a structural dependency amongst the reward distributions associated with the arms makes it challenging to identify a subset of alternatives that guarantees the optimal collective outcome. Thus, besides individual actions' reward, learning the causal relations is essential to improve the decision-making strategy. To solve the two-fold learning problem described above, we develop the 'combinatorial semi-bandit framework with causally related rewards', where we model the causal relations by a directed graph in a stationary structural equation model. The nodal observation in the graph signal comprises the corresponding base arm's instantaneous reward and an additional term resulting from the causal influences of other base arms' rewards. The objective is to maximize the long-term average payoff, which is a linear function of the base arms' rewards and depends strongly on the network topology. To achieve this objective, we propose a policy that determines the causal relations by learning the network's topology and simultaneously exploits this knowledge to optimize the decision-making process. We establish a sublinear regret bound for the proposed algorithm. Numerical experiments using synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to several benchmarks.

## [676] Robustness Guarantees for Credal Bayesian Networks via Constraint Relaxation over Probabilistic Circuits

**Authors**: *Hjalmar Wijk, Benjie Wang, Marta Kwiatkowska*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/677](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/677)

**Abstract**:

In many domains, worst-case guarantees on the performance (e.g. prediction accuracy) of a decision function subject to distributional shifts and uncertainty about the environment are crucial. In this work we develop a method to quantify the robustness of decision functions with respect to credal Bayesian networks, formal parametric models of the environment where uncertainty is expressed through credal sets on the parameters. In particular, we address the maximum marginal probability (MARmax) problem, that is, determining the greatest probability of an event (such as misclassification) obtainable for parameters in the credal set. We develop a method to faithfully transfer the problem into a constrained optimization problem on a probabilistic circuit. By performing a simple constraint relaxation, we show how to obtain a guaranteed upper bound on MARmax in linear time in the size of the circuit. We further theoretically characterize this constraint relaxation in terms of the original Bayesian network structure, which yields insight into the tightness of the bound. We implement the method and provide experimental evidence that the upper bound is often near tight and demonstrates improved scalability compared to other methods.

## [677] On Attacking Out-Domain Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Neural Networks

**Authors**: *Huimin Zeng, Zhenrui Yue, Yang Zhang, Ziyi Kou, Lanyu Shang, Dong Wang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/678](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/678)

**Abstract**:

In many applications with real-world consequences, it is crucial to develop reliable uncertainty estimation for the predictions made by the AI decision systems. Targeting at the goal of estimating uncertainty, various deep neural network (DNN) based uncertainty estimation algorithms have been proposed. However, the robustness of the uncertainty returned by these algorithms has not been systematically explored. In this work, to raise the awareness of the research community on robust uncertainty estimation, we show that state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation algorithms could fail catastrophically under our proposed adversarial attack despite their impressive performance on uncertainty estimation. In particular, we aim at attacking out-domain uncertainty estimation: under our attack, the uncertainty model would be fooled to make high-confident predictions for the out-domain data, which they originally would have rejected. Extensive experimental results on various benchmark image datasets show that the uncertainty estimated by state-of-the-art methods could be easily corrupted by our attack.

## [678] DPVI: A Dynamic-Weight Particle-Based Variational Inference Framework

**Authors**: *Chao Zhang, Zhijian Li, Xin Du, Hui Qian*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/679](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/679)

**Abstract**:

The recently developed Particle-based Variational Inference (ParVI) methods drive the empirical distribution of a set of fixed-weight particles towards a given target distribution by iteratively updating particles' positions. However, the fixed weight restriction greatly confines the empirical distribution's approximation ability, especially when the particle number is limited. In this paper, we propose to dynamically adjust particles' weights according to a Fisher-Rao reaction flow. We develop a general Dynamic-weight Particle-based Variational Inference (DPVI) framework according to a novel continuous composite flow, which evolves the positions and weights of particles simultaneously. We show that the mean-field limit of our composite flow is actually a Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flow of the associated dissimilarity functional. By using different finite-particle approximations in our general framework, we derive several efficient DPVI algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our derived DPVI algorithms over their fixed-weight counterparts.

**Authors**: *Sukanya Bhattacharjee, Parag Chaudhuri*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/680](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/680)

**Abstract**:

We present a deep neural framework that allows users to create surfaces from a stream of sparse 3D sketch strokes. Our network consists of a global surface estimation module followed by a local surface refinement. This facilitates in the incremental prediction of surfaces. Thus, our proposed method works with 3D sketch strokes and estimate a surface interactively in real time. We compare the proposed method with various state-of-the-art methods and show its efficacy for surface fitting. Further, we integrate our method into an existing Blender based 3D content creation pipeline to show its usefulness in 3D modelling.

## [680] Tradformer: A Transformer Model of Traditional Music Transcriptions

**Authors**: *Luca Casini, Bob L. T. Sturm*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/681](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/681)

**Abstract**:

We explore the transformer neural network architecture for modeling music, 
specifically Irish and Swedish traditional dance music.
Given the repetitive structures of these kinds of music, the transformer should be as successful with fewer parameters and complexity as the hitherto most successful model, a vanilla long short-term memory network.
We find that achieving good performance with the transformer is not straightforward,
and careful consideration is needed for the sampling strategy, 
evaluating intermediate outputs in relation to engineering choices, 
and finally analyzing what the model learns.
We discuss these points with several illustrations, 
providing reusable insights for engineering other music generation systems.
We also report the high performance of our final transformer model 
in a competition of music generation systems
focused on a type of Swedish dance.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/682](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/682)

**Abstract**:

Synthesizer is a type of electronic musical instrument that is now widely used in modern music production and sound design. Each parameters configuration of a synthesizer produces a unique timbre and can be viewed as a unique instrument. The problem of estimating a set of parameters configuration that best restore a sound timbre is an important yet complicated problem, i.e.: the synthesizer parameters estimation problem. We proposed a multi-modal deep-learning-based pipeline Sound2Synth, together with a network structure Prime-Dilated Convolution (PDC) specially designed to solve this problem. Our method achieved not only SOTA but also the first real-world applicable results on Dexed synthesizer, a popular FM synthesizer.

## [682] Towards Creativity Characterization of Generative Models via Group-Based Subset Scanning

**Authors**: *Celia Cintas, Payel Das, Brian Quanz, Girmaw Abebe Tadesse, Skyler Speakman, Pin-Yu Chen*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/683](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/683)

**Abstract**:

Deep generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have been employed widely in computational creativity research. However, such models discourage out-of-distribution generation to avoid spurious sample generation, thereby limiting their creativity. Thus, incorporating research on human creativity into generative deep learning techniques presents an opportunity to make their outputs more compelling and human-like.  As we see the emergence of generative models directed toward creativity research, a need for machine learning-based surrogate metrics to characterize creative output from these models is imperative. 
We propose group-based subset scanning to identify, quantify,  and characterize creative processes by detecting a subset of anomalous node-activations in the hidden layers of the generative models. 
Our experiments on the standard image benchmarks and their ``creatively generated'' variants reveal that the proposed subset scores distribution is more useful for detecting novelty in creative processes in the activation space rather than the pixel space. Further, we found that creative samples generate larger subsets of anomalies than normal or non-creative samples across datasets. The node activations highlighted during the creative decoding process are different from those responsible for the normal sample generation. Lastly, we assess if the images from the subsets selected by our method were also found creative by human evaluators, presenting a link between creativity perception in humans and node activations within deep neural nets.

**Abstract**:

Creating art is often viewed as a uniquely human endeavor. In this paper, we introduce a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) approach trained on large amounts of human paintings to synthesize realistic-looking paintings that emulate human art. Our approach is based on the StyleGAN neural network architecture, but incorporates a custom multi-conditional control mechanism that provides fine-granular control over characteristics of the generated paintings, e.g., with regard to the perceived emotion evoked in a spectator. We also investigate several evaluation techniques tailored to multi-conditional generation.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/685](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/685)

**Abstract**:

To best assist human designers with different styles, Machine Learning (ML) systems need to be able to adapt to them. However, there has been relatively little prior work on how and when to best adapt an ML system to a co-designer. In this paper we present threshold designer adaptation: a novel method for adapting a creative ML model to an individual designer. We evaluate our approach with a human subject study using a co-creative rhythm game design tool. We find that designers prefer our proposed method and produce higher quality content in comparison to an existing baseline.

## [685] Automated Sifting of Stories from Simulated Storyworlds

**Authors**: *Wilkins Leong, Julie Porteous, John Thangarajah*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/686](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/686)

**Abstract**:

Story sifting (or story recognition) allows for the exploration of events, stories, and patterns that emerge from simulated storyworlds. The goal of this work is to reduce the authoring burden for creating sifting queries. In this paper, we use the event traces of simulated storyworlds to create Dynamic Character Networks that track the changing relationship scores between characters in a simulation. These networks allow for the fortunes between any two characters to be plotted against time as a story arc. Similarity scores between story arcs from the simulation and a userâ€™s query arc can be calculated using the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. Events corresponding to the story arc that best matches the query arc can then be returned to the user, thus providing an intuitive means for users to sift a variety of stories without coding a search query. These components are implemented in our experimental prototype ARC SIFT. The results of a user study support our expectation that ARC SIFT is an intuitive and accurate tool that allows human users to sift stories out from a larger chronicle of events emerging from a simulated story world.

## [686] Universal Video Style Transfer via Crystallization, Separation, and Blending

**Authors**: *Haofei Lu, Zhizhong Wang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/687](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/687)

**Abstract**:

Universal video style transfer aims to migrate arbitrary styles to input videos. However, how to maintain the temporal consistency of videos while achieving high-quality arbitrary style transfer is still a hard nut to crack. To resolve this dilemma, in this paper, we propose the CSBNet which involves three key modules: 1) the Crystallization (Cr) Module that generates several orthogonal crystal nuclei, representing hierarchical stability-aware content and style components, from raw VGG features; 2) the Separation (Sp) Module that separates these crystal nuclei to generate the stability-enhanced content and style features; 3) the Blending (Bd) Module to cross-blend these stability-enhanced content and style features, producing more stable and higher-quality stylized videos. Moreover, we also introduce a new pair of component enhancement losses to improve network performance. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our CSBNet. Compared with the state-of-the-art models, it not only produces temporally more consistent and stable results for arbitrary videos but also achieves higher-quality stylizations for arbitrary images.

## [687] StyleCLIPDraw: Coupling Content and Style in Text-to-Drawing Translation

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/688](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/688)

**Abstract**:

Generating images that fit a given text description using machine learning has improved greatly with the release of technologies such as the CLIP image-text encoder model; however, current methods lack artistic control of the style of image to be generated. We present an approach for generating styled drawings for a given text description where a user can specify a desired drawing style using a sample image. Inspired by a theory in art that style and content are generally inseparable during the creative process, we propose a coupled approach, known here as StyleCLIPDraw, whereby the drawing is generated by optimizing for style and content simultaneously throughout the process as opposed to applying style transfer after creating content in a sequence. Based on human evaluation, the styles of images generated by StyleCLIPDraw are strongly preferred to those by the sequential approach. Although the quality of content generation degrades for certain styles, overall considering both content and style, StyleCLIPDraw is found far more preferred, indicating the importance of style, look, and feel of machine generated images to people as well as indicating that style is coupled in the drawing process itself. Our code, a demonstration, and style evaluation data are publicly available.

**Abstract**:

Character recognition models rely substantially on image datasets that maintain a balance of class samples. However, achieving a balance of classes is particularly challenging for ancient manuscript contexts as character instances may be significantly limited. In this paper, we present findings from a study that assess the efficacy of using synthetically generated character instances to augment an existing dataset of ancient Greek character images for use in machine learning models. We complement our model exploration by engaging professional papyrologists to better understand the practical opportunities afforded by synthetic instances. Our results suggest that synthetic instances improve model performance for limited character classes, and may have unexplored effects on character classes more generally. We also find that trained papyrologists are unable to distinguish between synthetic and non-synthetic images and regard synthetic instances as valuable assets for professional and educational contexts. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our research.

## [689] DivSwapper: Towards Diversified Patch-based Arbitrary Style Transfer

**Authors**: *Zhizhong Wang, Lei Zhao, Haibo Chen, Zhiwen Zuo, Ailin Li, Wei Xing, Dongming Lu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/690](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/690)

**Abstract**:

Gram-based and patch-based approaches are two important research lines of style transfer. Recent diversified Gram-based methods have been able to produce multiple and diverse stylized outputs for the same content and style images. However, as another widespread research interest, the diversity of patch-based methods remains challenging due to the stereotyped style swapping process based on nearest patch matching. To resolve this dilemma, in this paper, we dive into the crux of existing patch-based methods and propose a universal and efficient module, termed DivSwapper, for diversified patch-based arbitrary style transfer. The key insight is to use an essential intuition that neural patches with higher activation values could contribute more to diversity. Our DivSwapper is plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing patch-based and Gram-based methods to generate diverse results for arbitrary styles. We conduct theoretical analyses and extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, and compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, it shows superiority in diversity, quality, and efficiency.

## [690] Music-to-Dance Generation with Optimal Transport

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/691](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/691)

**Abstract**:

Dance choreography for a piece of music is a challenging task, having to be creative in presenting distinctive stylistic dance elements while taking into account the musical theme and rhythm. It has been tackled by different approaches such as similarity retrieval, sequence-to-sequence modeling and generative adversarial networks, but their generated dance sequences are often short of motion realism, diversity and music consistency. In this paper, we propose a Music-to-Dance with Optimal Transport Network (MDOT-Net) for learning to generate 3D dance choreographies from music. We introduce an optimal transport distance for evaluating the authenticity of the generated dance distribution and a Gromov-Wasserstein distance to measure the correspondence between the dance distribution and the input music. This gives a well defined and non-divergent training objective that mitigates the limitation of standard GAN training which is frequently plagued with instability and divergent generator loss issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDOT-Net can synthesize realistic and diverse dances which achieve an organic unity with the input music, reflecting the shared intentionality and matching the rhythmic articulation.

## [691] Composition-aware Graphic Layout GAN for Visual-Textual Presentation Designs

**Authors**: *Min Zhou, Chenchen Xu, Ye Ma, Tiezheng Ge, Yuning Jiang, Weiwei Xu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/692](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/692)

**Abstract**:

In this paper, we study the graphic layout generation problem of producing high-quality visual-textual presentation designs for given images. We note that image compositions, which contain not only global semantics but also spatial information, would largely affect layout results. Hence, we propose a deep generative model, dubbed as composition-aware graphic layout GAN (CGL-GAN), to synthesize layouts based on the global and spatial visual contents of input images. To obtain training images from images that already contain manually designed graphic layout data, previous work suggests masking design elements (e.g., texts and embellishments) as model inputs, which inevitably leaves hint of the ground truth. We study the misalignment between the training inputs (with hint masks) and test inputs (without masks), and design a novel domain alignment module (DAM) to narrow this gap. For training, we built a large-scale layout dataset which consists of 60,548 advertising posters with annotated layout information. To evaluate the generated layouts, we propose three novel metrics according to aesthetic intuitions. Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed model can synthesize high-quality graphic layouts according to image compositions. The data and code will be available at https://github.com/minzhouGithub/CGL-GAN.

## [692] Style Fader Generative Adversarial Networks for Style Degree Controllable Artistic Style Transfer

**Authors**: *Zhiwen Zuo, Lei Zhao, Shuobin Lian, Haibo Chen, Zhizhong Wang, Ailin Li, Wei Xing, Dongming Lu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/693](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/693)

**Abstract**:

Artistic style transfer is the task of synthesizing content images with learned artistic styles. Recent studies have shown the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for producing artistically rich stylizations. Despite the promising results, they usually fail to control the generated images' style degree, which is inflexible and limits their applicability for practical use. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose a novel method that for the first time allows adjusting the style degree for existing GAN-based artistic style transfer frameworks in real time after training. Our method introduces two novel modules into existing GAN-based artistic style transfer frameworks: a Style Scaling Injection (SSI) module and a Style Degree Interpretation (SDI) module. The SSI module accepts the value of Style Degree Factor (SDF)  as the input and outputs parameters that scale the feature activations in existing models, offering control signals to alter the style degrees of the stylizations.  And the SDI module interprets the output probabilities of a multi-scale content-style binary classifier as the style degrees, providing a mechanism to parameterize the style degree of the stylizations. Moreover, we show that after training our method can enable existing GAN-based frameworks to produce over-stylizations. The proposed method can facilitate many existing GAN-based artistic style transfer frameworks with marginal extra training overheads and modifications. Extensive qualitative evaluations on two typical GAN-based style transfer models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for gaining style degree control for them.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/694](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/694)

**Abstract**:

The artworks by Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch are well known for their incredible wealth of details. The popular BoschBot regularly posts small segments of the digitized paintings on Twitter, thus relieving their density and making them more accessible. CaptioningBoschBot, the Twitter bot presented in this demo, reverses the creative process of the artist: It uses the out-of-context painting segments as input for an encoder-decoder model to generate captions that interpret the painted objects. As the model was only trained on realistic, photographic images, curious interpretations of the otherworldly details can be observed. The generated captions are again posted on Twitter to encourage discussions about Bosch's masterpieces and the AI technology in general.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/695](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/695)

**Abstract**:

This paper outlines an automated creation system for Chinese landscape paintings based on generative adversarial networks. The system consists of three cascaded modules: generation, resizing, and super-resolution. The generation module first generates a square-shaped painting, then the resizing module predicts an appropriate aspect ratio for it and performs resizing, and finally the super-resolution module is used to increase the resolution and improve the quality. After training each module with the images we collected from the web, our system can create high-resolution landscape paintings in arbitrary sizes.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/697](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/697)

**Abstract**:

Air pollution monitoring and management is one of the key challenges for urban sectors, especially in developing countries. Measuring pollution levels requires significant investment in reliable and durable instrumentation and subsequent maintenance. On the other hand, there have been many attempts by researchers to develop image-based pollution measurement models which have shown significant results and established the feasibility of the idea. But, taking image-level models to a city-level system presents new challenges, which include scarcity of high-quality annotated data and a high amount of label noise. In this paper, we present a low-cost, end-to-end system for learning pollution maps using images captured through a mobile phone. We demonstrate our system for parts of New Delhi and Ghaziabad. We use transfer learning to overcome the problem of data scarcity. We investigate the effects of label noise in detail and introduce the metric of in-interval accuracy to evaluate our models in presence of noise. We use distributed averaging to learn pollution maps and mitigate the effects of noise to some extent. We also develop haze-based interpretable models which have comparable performance to mainstream models. With only 382 images from Delhi and Ghaziabad and single-scene dataset from Beijing and Shanghai, we are able to achieve a mean absolute error of 44 ug/m^3 in PM2.5 concentration on a test set of 267 images and an in-interval accuracy of 67% on predictions. Going further, we learn pollution maps with a mean absolute error as low as 35 ug/m^3 and in-interval accuracy as high as 74% significantly mitigating the image models' error. We also show that the noise in pollution labels emerging from unreliable sensing instrumentation forms a significant barrier to the realization of an ideal air pollution monitoring system.

## [697] Deciphering Environmental Air Pollution with Large Scale City Data

**Authors**: *Mayukh Bhattacharyya, Sayan Nag, Udita Ghosh*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/698](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/698)

**Abstract**:

Air pollution poses a serious threat to sustainable environmental conditions in the 21st century. Its importance in determining the health and living standards in urban settings is only expected to increase with time. Various factors ranging from artificial emissions to natural phenomena are known to be primary causal agents or influencers behind rising air pollution levels. However, the lack of large scale data involving the major artificial and natural factors has hindered the research on the causes and relations governing the variability of the different air pollutants. Through this work, we introduce a large scale city-wise dataset for exploring the relationships among these agents over a long period of time. We also introduce a transformer based model - cosSquareFormer, for the problem of pollutant level estimation and forecasting. Our model outperforms most of the benchmark models for this task. We also analyze and explore the dataset through our model and other methodologies to bring out important inferences which enable us to understand the dynamics of the casual agents at a deeper level. Through our paper, we seek to provide a great set of foundations for further research into this domain that will demand critical attention of ours in the near future.

## [698] Chronic Disease Management with Personalized Lab Test Response Prediction

**Authors**: *Suman Bhoi, Mong-Li Lee, Wynne Hsu, Andrew Hao Sen Fang, Ngiap Chuan Tan*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/699](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/699)

**Abstract**:

Chronic disease management involves frequent administration of invasive lab procedures in order for
clinicians to determine the best course of treatment
regimes for these patients. However, patients are
often put off by these invasive lab procedures and
do not follow the appointment schedules. This has
resulted in poor management of their chronic conditions leading to unnecessary disease complications. An AI system that is able to personalize the
prediction of individual patient lab test responses
will enable clinicians to titrate the medications to
achieve the desired therapeutic outcome.  Accurate prediction of lab test response is a challenge because these patients typically have co-morbidities and their treatments might influence the target lab test response. To address this,
we model the complex interactions among different medications, diseases, lab test response, and
fine-grained dosage information to learn a strong
patient representation. Together with information
from similar patients and external knowledge such
as drug-lab interactions and diagnosis-lab interaction, we design a system called KALP to perform
personalized prediction of patients’ response for a
target lab result and identify the top influencing
factors for the prediction. Experiment results on
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
KALP in reducing prediction errors by a significant
margin. Case studies show that the identified factors are consistent with clinicians’ understanding.

## [699] AggPose: Deep Aggregation Vision Transformer for Infant Pose Estimation

**Authors**: *Xu Cao, Xiaoye Li, Liya Ma, Yi Huang, Xuan Feng, Zening Chen, Hongwu Zeng, Jianguo Cao*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/700](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/700)

**Abstract**:

Movement and pose assessment of newborns lets experienced pediatricians predict neurodevelopmental disorders, allowing early intervention for related diseases. However, most of the newest AI approaches for human pose estimation methods focus on adults, lacking publicly benchmark for infant pose estimation. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing infant pose dataset and Deep Aggregation Vision Transformer for human pose estimation, which introduces a fast trained full transformer framework without using convolution operations to extract features in the early stages. It generalizes Transformer + MLP to high-resolution deep layer aggregation within feature maps, thus enabling information fusion between different vision levels. We pre-train AggPose on COCO pose dataset and apply it on our newly released large-scale infant pose estimation dataset. The results show that AggPose could effectively learn the multi-scale features among different resolutions and significantly improve the performance of infant pose estimation. We show that AggPose outperforms hybrid model HRFormer and TokenPose in the infant pose estimation dataset. Moreover, our AggPose outperforms HRFormer by 0.8 AP on COCO val pose estimation on average.  Our code is available at github.com/SZAR-LAB/AggPose.

## [700] Forecasting Patient Outcomes in Kidney Exchange

**Authors**: *Naveen Durvasula, Aravind Srinivasan, John P. Dickerson*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/701](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/701)

**Abstract**:

Kidney exchanges allow patients with end-stage renal disease to find a lifesaving living donor by way of an organized market.  However, not all patients are equally easy to match, nor are all donor organs of equal quality---some patients are matched within weeks, while others may wait for years with no match offers at all. We propose the first decision-support tool for kidney exchange that takes as input the biological features of a patient-donor pair, and returns (i) the probability of being matched prior to expiry, and (conditioned on a match outcome), (ii) the waiting time for and (iii) the organ quality of the matched transplant.  This information may be used to inform medical and insurance decisions. We predict all quantities (i, ii, iii) exclusively from match records that are readily available in any kidney exchange using a quantile random forest approach. To evaluate our approach, we developed two state-of-the-art realistic simulators based on data from the United Network for Organ Sharing that sample from the training and test distribution for these learning tasks---in our application these distributions are distinct. We analyze distributional shift through a theoretical lens, and show that the two distributions converge as the kidney exchange nears steady-state. We then show that our approach produces clinically-promising estimates using simulated data. Finally, we show how our approach, in conjunction with tools from the model explainability literature, can be used to calibrate and detect bias in matching policies.

## [701] A Murder and Protests, the Capitol Riot, and the Chauvin Trial: Estimating Disparate News Media Stance

**Authors**: *Sujan Dutta, Beibei Li, Daniel S. Nagin, Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/702](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/702)

**Abstract**:

In this paper, we analyze the responses of three major US cable news networks to three seminal policing events in the US spanning a thirteen month period--the murder of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin, the Capitol riot, Chauvin's conviction, and his sentencing. We cast the problem of aggregate stance mining as a natural language inference task and construct an active learning pipeline for robust textual entailment prediction. Via a substantial corpus of 34,710 news transcripts, our analyses reveal that the partisan divide in viewership of these three outlets reflects on the network's news coverage of these momentous events. In addition, we release a sentence-level, domain-specific text entailment data set on policing consisting of 2,276 annotated instances.

## [702] Monitoring Vegetation From Space at Extremely Fine Resolutions via Coarsely-Supervised Smooth U-Net

**Authors**: *Joshua Fan, Di Chen, Jiaming Wen, Ying Sun, Carla P. Gomes*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/703](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/703)

**Abstract**:

Monitoring vegetation productivity at extremely fine resolutions is valuable for real-world agricultural applications, such as detecting crop stress and providing early warning of food insecurity. Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) provides a promising way to directly measure plant productivity from space. However, satellite SIF observations are only available at a coarse spatial resolution, making it impossible to monitor how individual crop types or farms are doing. This poses a challenging coarsely-supervised regression (or downscaling) task; at training time, we only have SIF labels at a coarse resolution (3km), but we want to predict SIF at much finer spatial resolutions (e.g. 30m, a 100x increase). We also have additional fine-resolution input features, but the relationship between these features and SIF is unknown. To address this, we propose Coarsely-Supervised Smooth U-Net (CS-SUNet), a novel method for this coarse supervision setting. CS-SUNet combines the expressive power of deep convolutional networks with novel regularization methods based on prior knowledge (such as a smoothness loss) that are crucial for preventing overfitting. Experiments show that CS-SUNet resolves fine-grained variations in SIF more accurately than existing methods.

## [703] Am I No Good? Towards Detecting Perceived Burdensomeness and Thwarted Belongingness from Suicide Notes

**Authors**: *Soumitra Ghosh, Asif Ekbal, Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/704](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/704)

**Abstract**:

The World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the importance of significantly accelerating suicide prevention efforts to fulfill the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) objective of 2030. In this paper, we present an end-to-end multitask system to address a novel task of detection of two interpersonal risk factors of suicide, Perceived Burdensomeness (PB) and Thwarted Belongingness (TB) from suicide notes. We also introduce a manually translated code-mixed suicide notes corpus, CoMCEASE-v2.0, based on the benchmark CEASE-v2.0 dataset, annotated with temporal orientation, PB and TB labels. We exploit the temporal orientation and emotion information in the suicide notes to boost overall performance. For comprehensive evaluation of our proposed method, we compare it to several state-of-the-art approaches on the existing CEASE-v2.0 dataset and the newly announced CoMCEASE-v2.0 dataset. Empirical evaluation suggests that temporal and emotional information can substantially improve the detection of PB and TB.

## [704] AI Facilitated Isolations? The Impact of Recommendation-based Influence Diffusion in Human Society

**Authors**: *Yuxuan Hu, Shiqing Wu, Chenting Jiang, Weihua Li, Quan Bai, Erin Roehrer*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/705](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/705)

**Abstract**:

AI recommendation techniques provide users with personalized services, feeding them the information they may be interested in. The increasing personalization raises the hypotheses of the "filter bubble" and "echo chamber" effects. To investigate these hypotheses, in this paper, we inspect the impact of recommendation algorithms on forming two types of ideological isolation, i.e., the individual isolation and the topological isolation, in terms of the filter bubble and echo chamber effects, respectively. Simulation results show that AI recommendation strategies severely facilitate the evolution of the filter bubble effect, leading users to become ideologically isolated at an individual level. Whereas, at a topological level, recommendation algorithms show eligibility in connecting individuals with dissimilar users or recommending diverse topics to receive more diverse viewpoints. This research sheds light on the ability of AI recommendation strategies to temper ideological isolation at a topological level.

## [705] Crowd, Expert & AI: A Human-AI Interactive Approach Towards Natural Language Explanation Based COVID-19 Misinformation Detection

**Authors**: *Ziyi Kou, Lanyu Shang, Yang Zhang, Zhenrui Yue, Huimin Zeng, Dong Wang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/706](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/706)

**Abstract**:

In this paper, we study an explainable COVID-19 misinformation detection problem where the goal is to accurately identify COVID-19 misleading posts on social media and explain the posts with natural language explanations (NLEs). Our problem is motivated by the limitations of current explainable misinformation detection approaches that cannot provide NLEs for COVID-19 posts due to the lack of sufficient professional COVID-19 knowledge for supervision. To address such a limitation, we develop CEA-COVID, a crowd-expert-AI framework that jointly exploits the common logical reasoning ability of online crowd workers and the professional knowledge of COVID-19 experts to effectively generate NLEs for detecting and explaining COVID-19 misinformation. We evaluate CEA-COVID using two public COVID-19 misinformation datasets on social media. Results demonstrate that CEA-COVID outperforms existing explainable misinformation detection models in terms of both explainability and detection accuracy.

## [706] Towards the Quantitative Interpretability Analysis of Citizens Happiness Prediction

**Authors**: *Lin Li, Xiaohua Wu, Miao Kong, Dong Zhou, Xiaohui Tao*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/707](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/707)

**Abstract**:

Evaluating the high-effect factors of citizens' happiness is beneficial to a wide range of policy-making for economics and politics in most countries. Benefiting from the high-efficiency of regression models, previous efforts by sociology scholars have analyzed the effect of happiness factors with high interpretability. However, restricted to their research concerns, they are specifically interested in some subset of factors modeled as linear functions. Recently, deep learning shows promising prediction accuracy while addressing challenges in interpretability. To this end, we introduce Shapley value that is inherent in solid theory for factor contribution interpretability to work with deep learning models by taking into account interactions between multiple factors. The proposed solution computes the Shapley value of a factor, i.e., its average contribution to the prediction in different coalitions based on coalitional game theory. Aiming to evaluate the interpretability quality of our solution, experiments are conducted on a Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) questionnaire dataset. Through systematic reviews, the experimental results of Shapley value are highly consistent with academic studies in social science, which implies our solution for citizens' happiness prediction has 2-fold implications, theoretically and practically.

## [707] S2SNet: A Pretrained Neural Network for Superconductivity Discovery

**Authors**: *Ke Liu, Kaifan Yang, Jiahong Zhang, Renjun Xu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/708](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/708)

**Abstract**:

Superconductivity allows electrical current to flow without any energy loss, and thus making solids superconducting is a grand goal of physics, material science, and electrical engineering. More than 16 Nobel Laureates have been awarded for their contribution in superconductivity research. Superconductors are valuable  for sustainable development goals (SDGs), such as climate change mitigation, affordable and clean energy, industry, innovation and infrastructure, and so on. However, a unified physics theory explaining all superconductivity mechanism is still unknown. It is believed that superconductivity is microscopically due to not only molecular compositions but also the geometric crystal structure. Hence a new dataset, S2S, containing both crystal structures and superconducting critical temperature, is built upon SuperCon and Material Project. Based on this new dataset, we propose a novel model, S2SNet, which utilizes the attention mechanism for superconductivity prediction. To overcome the shortage of data, S2SNet is pre-trained on the whole Material Project dataset with Masked-Language Modeling (MLM). S2SNet makes a new state-of-the-art, with out-of-sample accuracy of 92% and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.92. To the best of our knowledge, S2SNet is the first work to predict superconductivity with only information of crystal structures. This work is beneficial to superconductivity discovery and further SDGs. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/supercond/S2SNet

## [708] Creating Dynamic Checklists via Bayesian Case-Based Reasoning: Towards Decent Working Conditions for All

**Authors**: *Eirik Lund Flogard, Ole Jakob Mengshoel, Kerstin Bach*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/709](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/709)

**Abstract**:

Every year there are 1.9 million deaths world-wide attributed to occupational health and safety risk factors. To address poor working conditions and fulfill UN's SDG 8, "protect labour rights and promote safe working environments for all workers", governmental agencies conduct labour inspections, using checklists to survey individual organisations for working environment violations. Recent research highlights the benefits of using machine learning for creating checklists. However, the current methods only create static checklists and do not adapt them to new information that surfaces during use. In contrast, we propose a new method called Context-aware Bayesian Case-Based Reasoning (CBCBR) that creates dynamic checklists. These checklists are continuously adapted as the inspections progress, based on how they are answered. Our evaluations show that CBCBR's dynamic checklists outperform static checklists created via the current state-of-the-art methods, increasing the expected number of working environment violations found in the labour inspections.

## [709] A Reliability-aware Distributed Framework to Schedule Residential Charging of Electric Vehicles

**Authors**: *Rounak Meyur, Swapna Thorve, Madhav V. Marathe, Anil Vullikanti, Samarth Swarup, Henning S. Mortveit*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/710](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/710)

**Abstract**:

Residential consumers have become active participants in the power distribution network after being equipped with residential EV charging provisions. This creates a challenge for the network operator tasked with dispatching electric power to the residential consumers through the existing distribution network infrastructure in a reliable manner. In this paper, we address the problem of scheduling residential EV charging for multiple consumers while maintaining network reliability. An additional challenge is the restricted exchange of information: where the consumers do not have access to network information and the network operator does not have access  to consumer load parameters. We propose a distributed framework which generates an optimal EV charging schedule for individual residential consumers based on their preferences and iteratively updates it until the network reliability constraints set by the operator are satisfied. We validate the proposed approach for different EV adoption levels in a synthetically created digital twin of an actual power distribution network. The results demonstrate that the new approach can achieve a higher level of network reliability compared to the case where residential consumers charge EVs based solely on their individual preferences, thus providing a solution for the existing grid to keep up with increased adoption rates without significant investments in increasing grid capacity.

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/711](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/711)

**Abstract**:

With the increasing popularity of food delivery platforms, it has become pertinent to look into the working conditions of the `gig' workers in these platforms, especially providing them fair wages, reasonable working hours, and transparency on work availability. However, any solution to these problems must not degrade customer experience and be cost-effective to ensure that platforms are willing to adopt them. We propose Work4Food, which provides income guarantees to delivery agents, while minimizing platform costs and ensuring customer satisfaction. Work4Food ensures that the income guarantees are met in such a way that it does not lead to increased working hours or degrade environmental impact. To incorporate these objectives, Work4Food balances supply and demand by controlling the number of agents in the system and providing dynamic payment guarantees to agents based on factors such as agent location, ratings, etc. We evaluate Work4Food on a real-world dataset from a leading food delivery platform and establish its advantages over the state of the art in terms of the multi-dimensional objectives at hand.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/712](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/712)

**Abstract**:

More than 5 million children under five years die from largely preventable or treatable medical conditions every year, with an overwhelmingly large proportion of deaths occurring in under-developed countries with low vaccination uptake. One of the United Nations' sustainable development goals (SDG 3) aims to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under five years of age. We focus on Nigeria, where the rate of infant mortality is appalling. We collaborate with HelpMum, a large non-profit organization in Nigeria, to design and optimize the allocation of heterogeneous health interventions under uncertainty to increase vaccination uptake, the first such collaboration in Nigeria. Our framework, ADVISER: AI-Driven Vaccination Intervention Optimiser, is based on an integer linear program that seeks to maximize the cumulative probability of successful vaccination. Our optimization formulation is intractable in practice. We present a heuristic approach that enables us to solve the problem for real-world use-cases. We also present theoretical bounds for the heuristic method. Finally, we show that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in terms of vaccination uptake through experimental evaluation. HelpMum is currently planning a pilot program based on our approach to be deployed in the largest city of Nigeria, which would be the first deployment of an AI-driven vaccination uptake program in the country and hopefully, pave the way for other data-driven programs to improve health outcomes in Nigeria.

## [712] Ownership Concentration and Wealth Inequality in Russia

**Authors**: *Kirill Polovnikov, Nikita Pospelov, Dmitriy Skougarevskiy*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/713](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/713)

**Abstract**:

Knowledge of beneficial owners of companies is key to monitoring and managing wealth inequality in any country. Here we propose a robust and scalable network-based algorithm to reveal hidden ultimate owners in public ownership data. Our approach is based on the idea of Katz centrality in complex networks and circumvents the problem of cyclic ownership used to obscure effective control
through closed chains of intermediaries. When applied to a country-scale directed ownership network with 6 million nodes, the algorithm identifies ultimate holders of every organisation in 2021’s Russia. The distribution of asset ownership in the country follows a power law, indicating strong wealth inequality with Gini index of 0.93. 51.7% of net assets of non-financial companies are ultimately held by the state and state-owned enterprises, 25.0% — by individuals (incl. 3.4% held by Forbes–200-listed individuals), and 11.3% are owned by foreign entities (incl. 5.7% in tax havens).

## [713] DiRe Committee : Diversity and Representation Constraints in Multiwinner Elections

**Authors**: *Kunal Relia*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/714](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/714)

**Abstract**:

The study of fairness in multiwinner elections focuses on settings where candidates have attributes. However, voters may also be divided into predefined populations under one or more attributes. The models that focus on candidate attributes alone may systematically under-represent smaller voter populations. Hence, we develop a model, DiRe Committee Winner Determination (DRCWD), which delineates candidate and voter attributes to select a committee by specifying diversity and representation constraints and a voting rule. We analyze its computational complexity and develop a heuristic algorithm, which finds the winning DiRe committee in under two minutes on 63% of the instances of synthetic datasets and on 100% of instances of real-world datasets. We also present an empirical analysis of feasibility and utility traded-off. 

Moreover, even when the attributes of candidates and voters coincide, it is important to treat them separately as diversity does not imply representation and vice versa. This is to say that having a female candidate on the committee, for example, is different from having a candidate on the committee who is preferred by the female voters, and who themselves may or may not be female.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/715](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/715)

**Abstract**:

Pretraining domain-specific language models remains an important challenge which limits their applicability in various areas such as agriculture. This paper investigates the effectiveness of leveraging food related text corpora (e.g., food and agricultural literature) in pretraining transformer-based language models. We evaluate our trained language model, called AgriBERT, on the task of semantic matching, i.e., establishing mapping between food descriptions and nutrition data, which is a long-standing challenge in the agricultural domain. In particular, we formulate the task as an answer selection problem, fine-tune the trained language model with the help of an external source of knowledge (e.g., FoodOn ontology), and establish a baseline for this task. The experimental results reveal that our language model substantially outperforms other language models and baselines in the task of matching food description and nutrition.

## [715] CounterGeDi: A Controllable Approach to Generate Polite, Detoxified and Emotional Counterspeech

**Authors**: *Punyajoy Saha, Kanishk Singh, Adarsh Kumar, Binny Mathew, Animesh Mukherjee*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/716](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/716)

**Abstract**:

Recently, many studies have tried to create generation models to assist counter speakers by providing counterspeech suggestions for combating the explosive proliferation of online hate. However, since these suggestions are from a vanilla generation model, they might not include the appropriate properties required to counter a particular hate speech instance. In this paper, we propose CounterGeDi - an ensemble of generative discriminators (GeDi) to guide the generation of a DialoGPT model toward more polite, detoxified, and emotionally laden counterspeech. We generate counterspeech using three datasets and observe significant improvement across different attribute scores. The politeness and detoxification scores increased by around 15% and 6% respectively, while the emotion in the counterspeech increased by at least 10% across all the datasets. We also experiment with triple-attribute control and observe significant improvement over single attribute results when combining complementing attributes, e.g., politeness, joyfulness and detoxification. In all these experiments, the relevancy of the generated text does not deteriorate due to the application of these controls.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/717](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/717)

**Abstract**:

We study the problem of designing scalable algorithms to find effective intervention strategies for controlling stochastic epidemic processes on networks. This is a common problem arising in agent based models for epidemic spread.
Previous approaches to this problem focus on either heuristics with no guarantees or approximation algorithms that scale only to networks corresponding to county-sized populations, typically, with less than a million nodes. In particular, the mathematical-programming based approaches need to solve the Linear Program (LP) relaxation of the problem using an LP solver, which restricts the scalability of this approach. In this work, we overcome this restriction by designing an algorithm that adapts the multiplicative weights update (MWU) framework, along with the sample average approximation (SAA) technique, to approximately solve the linear program (LP) relaxation for the problem. To scale this approach further, we provide a memory-efficient algorithm that enables scaling to large networks, corresponding to country-size populations, with over 300 million nodes and 30  billion edges. Furthermore, we show that this approach provides near-optimal solutions to the LP in practice.

## [717] Revealing the Excitation Causality between Climate and Political Violence via a Neural Forward-Intensity Poisson Process

**Authors**: *Schyler C. Sun, Bailu Jin, Zhuangkun Wei, Weisi Guo*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/718](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/718)

**Abstract**:

The causal mechanism between climate and political violence is fraught with complex mechanisms. Current quantitative causal models rely on one or more assumptions: (1) the climate drivers persistently generate conflict, (2) the causal mechanisms have a linear relationship with the conflict generation parameter, and/or (3) there is sufficient data to inform the prior distribution. Yet, we know conflict drivers often excite a social transformation process which leads to violence (e.g., drought forces agricultural producers to join urban militia), but further climate effects do not necessarily contribute to further violence. Therefore, not only is this bifurcation relationship highly non-linear, there is also often a lack of data to support prior assumptions for high resolution modeling. 

Here, we aim to overcome the aforementioned causal modeling challenges by proposing a neural forward-intensity Poisson process (NFIPP) model. The NFIPP is designed to capture the potential non-linear causal mechanism in climate induced political violence, whilst being robust to sparse and timing-uncertain data. Our results span 20 recent years and reveal an excitation-based causal link between extreme climate events and political violence across diverse countries. Our climate-induced conflict model results are cross-validated against qualitative climate vulnerability indices. Furthermore, we label historical events that either improve or reduce our predictability gain, demonstrating the importance of domain expertise in informing interpretation.

**Abstract**:

Eviction of tenants has reached a crisis level in the U.S. and its consequences pose significant challenges to society. To tackle this eviction crisis, policymakers have been allocating financial resources but a more efficient resource allocation would need an accurate forecast of the number of tenants at-risk of evictions ahead of time. To help enhance the existing eviction prevention/diversion programs, in this work, we propose a multi-view deep neural network model, named as MARTIAN, that forecasts the number of tenants at-risk of getting formally evicted (at the census tract level) n months into the future. Then, we evaluate MARTIAN’s predictive performance under various conditions using real-world eviction cases filed across Dallas County, TX. The results of empirical evaluation show that MARTIAN outperforms an extensive set of baseline models in terms of predictive performance. Additionally, MARTIAN’s superior predictive performance is generalizable to unseen census tracts, for which no labeled data is available in the training set. This research has been done in collaboration with Child Poverty Action Lab (CPAL), which is a pioneering non-governmental organization (NGO) working for tackling poverty-related issues across Dallas County, TX. The usability of MARTIAN is under review by subject matter experts. We release our codebase at https://github.com/maryam-tabar/MARTIAN.

## [719] Dynamic Structure Learning through Graph Neural Network for Forecasting Soil Moisture in Precision Agriculture

**Authors**: *Anoushka Vyas, Sambaran Bandyopadhyay*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/720](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/720)

**Abstract**:

Soil moisture is an important component of precision agriculture as it directly impacts the growth and quality of vegetation. Forecasting soil moisture is essential to schedule the irrigation and optimize the use of water. Physics based soil moisture models need rich features and heavy computation which is not scalable. In recent literature, conventional machine learning models have been applied for this problem. These models are fast and simple, but they often fail to capture the spatio-temporal correlation that soil moisture exhibits over a region. In this work, we propose a novel graph neural network based solution that learns temporal graph structures and forecast soil moisture in an end-to-end framework. Our solution is able to handle the problem of missing ground truth soil moisture which is common in practice. We show the merit of our algorithm on real-world soil moisture data.

## [720] Quantifying Health Inequalities Induced by Data and AI Models

**Authors**: *Honghan Wu, Aneeta Sylolypavan, Minhong Wang, Sarah Wild*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/721](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/721)

**Abstract**:

AI technologies are being increasingly tested and applied in critical environments including healthcare. Without an effective way to detect and mitigate AI induced inequalities, AI might do more harm than good, potentially leading to the widening of underlying inequalities. This paper proposes a generic allocation-deterioration framework for detecting and quantifying AI induced inequality. Specifically, AI induced inequalities are quantified as the area between two allocation-deterioration curves. To assess the frameworkâ€™s performance, experiments were conducted on ten synthetic datasets (N>33,000) generated from HiRID - a real-world Intensive Care Unit (ICU) dataset, showing its ability to accurately detect and quantify inequality proportionally to controlled inequalities. Extensive analyses were carried out to quantify health inequalities (a) embedded in two real-world ICU datasets; (b) induced by AI models trained for two resource allocation scenarios. Results showed that compared to men, women had up to 33% poorer deterioration in markers of prognosis when admitted to HiRID ICUs. All four AI models assessed were shown to induce significant inequalities (2.45% to 43.2%) for non-White compared to White patients. The models exacerbated data embedded inequalities significantly in 3 out of 8 assessments, one of which was >9 times worse.

## [721] Sequential Vaccine Allocation with Delayed Feedback

**Authors**: *Yichen Xiao, Han-Ching Ou, Haipeng Chen, Van Thieu Nguyen, Long Tran-Thanh*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/722](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/722)

**Abstract**:

In this work we consider the problem of how to best allocate a limited supply of vaccines in the aftermath of an infectious disease outbreak by viewing the problem as a sequential game between a learner and an environment (specifically, a bandit problem). The difficulty of this problem lies in the fact that the payoff of vaccination cannot be directly observed, making it difficult to compare the relative effectiveness of vaccination on different population groups. Currently used vaccination policies make recommendations based on mathematical modelling and ethical considerations. These policies are static, and do not adapt as conditions change. Our aim is to design and evaluate an algorithm which can make use of routine surveillance data to dynamically adjust its recommendation. We evaluate the performance of our approach by applying it to a simulated epidemic of a disease based on real-world COVID-19 data, and show that our vaccination policy was able to perform better than existing vaccine allocation policies.
In particular, we show that with our allocation method, we can reduce the number of required vaccination by at least 50% in order to keep the peak number of hospitalised patients below a certain threshold. Also, when the same batch sizes are used, our method can reduce the peak number of hospitalisation by up to 20%.
We also demonstrate that our vaccine allocation does not vary the number of batches per group much, making it socially more acceptable (as it reduces uncertainty, hence results in better and more interpretable communication).

## [722] Ranked Prioritization of Groups in Combinatorial Bandit Allocation

**Authors**: *Lily Xu, Arpita Biswas, Fei Fang, Milind Tambe*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/723](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/723)

**Abstract**:

Preventing poaching through ranger patrols protects endangered wildlife, directly contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goal 15 of life on land. Combinatorial bandits have been used to allocate limited patrol resources, but existing approaches overlook the fact that each location is home to multiple species in varying proportions, so a patrol benefits each species to differing degrees. When some species are more vulnerable, we ought to offer more protection to these animals; unfortunately, existing combinatorial bandit approaches do not offer a way to prioritize important species. To bridge this gap, (1) We propose a novel combinatorial bandit objective that trades off between reward maximization and also accounts for prioritization over species, which we call ranked prioritization. We show this objective can be expressed as a weighted linear sum of Lipschitz-continuous reward functions. (2) We provide RankedCUCB, an algorithm to select combinatorial actions that optimize our prioritization-based objective, and prove that it achieves asymptotic no-regret. (3) We demonstrate empirically that RankedCUCB leads to up to 38% improvement in outcomes for endangered species using real-world wildlife conservation data. Along with adapting to other challenges such as preventing illegal logging and overfishing, our no-regret algorithm addresses the general combinatorial bandit problem with a weighted linear objective.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/724](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/724)

**Abstract**:

We present a novel dataset of dialogues containing interruption with an aim to conduct a large-scale analysis of interruption patterns of people from diverse backgrounds in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, occupation, and political orientation. Our dataset includes 625,409 dialogues containing interruptions found in 275,420 transcripts from CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC spanning between January 2000 and July 2021. From this large, unlabeled pool of interruptions, we release an annotated dataset consisting of 2,000 dialogues with fine-grained interruption labels. We use this dataset to train an interruption classifier and predict the interruption type of a given dialogue. Our results reveal that male speakers (in our collected samples) tend to talk more than female speakers, while female speakers interrupt more. Moreover, people tend to use less intrusive interruptions when talking to others sharing the same political belief. This pattern becomes more pronounced among news media with stronger political bias.

## [724] Psychiatric Scale Guided Risky Post Screening for Early Detection of Depression

**Authors**: *Zhiling Zhang, Siyuan Chen, Mengyue Wu, Kenny Q. Zhu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/725](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/725)

**Abstract**:

Depression is a prominent health challenge to the world, and early risk detection (ERD) of depression from online posts can be a promising technique for combating the threat. Early depression detection faces the challenge of efficiently tackling streaming data, balancing the tradeoff between timeliness, accuracy and explainability. To tackle these challenges, we propose a psychiatric scale guided risky post screening method that can capture risky posts related to the dimensions defined in clinical depression scales, and providing interpretable diagnostic basis. A Hierarchical Attentional Network equipped with BERT (HAN-BERT) is proposed to further advance explainable predictions. For ERD, we propose an online algorithm based on an evolving queue of risky posts that can significantly reduce the number of model inferences to boost efficiency. Experiments show that our method outperforms the competitive feature-based and neural models under conventional depression detection settings, and achieves simultaneous improvement in both efficacy and efficiency for ERD.

## [725] A norm optimisation approach to SDGs: tackling poverty by acting on discrimination

**Authors**: *Georgina Curto, Nieves Montes, Carles Sierra, Nardine Osman, Flavio Comim*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/726](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/726)

**Abstract**:

Policies that seek to mitigate poverty by acting on equal opportunity have been found to aggravate discrimination against the poor (aporophobia), since individuals are made responsible for not progressing in the social hierarchy. Only a minority of the poor benefit from meritocracy in this era of growing inequality,  generating resentment among those who seek to escape their needy situations by trying to climb up  the  ladder.   Through  the  formulation  and  development of an agent-based social simulation, this study aims to analyse the role of norms implementing equal opportunity and social solidarity principles as enhancers or mitigators of aporophobia, as well as the threshold of aporophobia that would facilitate  the  success  of  poverty-reduction  policies. The ultimate goal of the social simulation is to extract  insights  that  could  help  inform  and  guide  a new  generation  of  policy  making  for  poverty  reduction  by  acting on the discrimination against the poor,  in  line  with the  UN  “Leave  No  One  Behind”  principle.    An “aporophobia-meter” will be developed and guidelines will be drafted based on both the simulation results and a review of poverty reduction policies at regional levels.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/727](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/727)

**Abstract**:

Equitable and inclusive quality education is a human right. It is crucial to provide for the learning needs of every child, especially those with learning disabilities. Traditional approaches to learning propose education paths performed with speech therapists. One of the most efficient strategies to help children with reading comprehension difficulties is the creation of a ``concept map'', a structured summary of the written text in a graph structure. Online tools that offer students the possibility to manually create or automatically extract concept maps from text have been created over the years. However, there is still a shortage of software that are specifically designed for children at risk and which produce a concept map that is tailored to the clinical profiles of individuals. In this Project Collaboration, we want to tackle this gap by implementing a multi-modal, online and open-access Artificial-Intelligence powered tool that could help these children to make sense of written text by enabling them to interactively create concept maps. The expected output is threefold. We will implement a new model for concept-map-based document summarization and a clinically appropriate web interface. We will evaluate them in real-world settings through user studies performed by speech therapists.

## [729] On the Expressivity of Markov Reward (Extended Abstract)

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/730](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/730)

**Abstract**:

Reward  is  the  driving  force  for  reinforcement-learning agents.  We here set out to understand the expressivity of Markov reward as a way to capture tasks that we would want an agent to perform.  We frame this study around three new abstract notions of "task":  (1) a set of acceptable behaviors, (2) a partial ordering over behaviors, or (3) a partial ordering over trajectories. Our main results prove that while reward can express many of these tasks, there exist instances  of  each  task  type  that  no  Markov reward  function  can  capture.   We  then  provide  a set of polynomial-time algorithms that construct a Markov reward function that allows an agent to perform each task type, and correctly determine when no such reward function exists.

## [730] Improving Inductive Link Prediction Using Hyper-Relational Facts (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Mehdi Ali, Max Berrendorf, Mikhail Galkin, Veronika Thost, Tengfei Ma, Volker Tresp, Jens Lehmann*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/731](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/731)

**Abstract**:

For many years, link prediction on knowledge. graphs has been a purely transductive task, not allowing for reasoning on unseen entities. 
Recently, increasing efforts are put into exploring semi- and fully inductive scenarios, enabling inference over unseen and emerging entities.
Still, all these approaches only consider triple-based KGs, whereas their richer counterparts, hyper-relational KGs (e.g., Wikidata), have not yet been properly studied.
In this work, we classify different inductive settings and study the benefits of employing hyper-relational KGs on a wide range of semi- and fully inductive link prediction tasks powered by recent advancements in graph neural networks. 
Our experiments on a novel set of benchmarks show that qualifiers over typed edges can lead to performance improvements of 6% of absolute gains (for the Hits@10 metric) compared to triple-only baselines.

## [731] Utilizing Treewidth for Quantitative Reasoning on Epistemic Logic Programs (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Viktor Besin, Markus Hecher, Stefan Woltran*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/732](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/732)

**Abstract**:

Extending the popular Answer Set Programming (ASP) paradigm by introspective reasoning capacities has received increasing interest within the last years. Particular attention is given to the formalism of epistemic logic programs (ELPs) where standard rules are equipped with modal operators which allow to express conditions on literals for being known or possible, i.e., contained in all or some answer sets, respectively. ELPs thus deliver multiple collections of answer sets, known as world views. Employing ELPs for reasoning problems so far has mainly been restricted to standard deci- sion problems (complexity analysis) and enumeration (development of systems) of world views. In this paper, we first establish quantitative reasoning for ELPs, where the acceptance of a certain set of literals depends on the number (proportion) of world views that are compatible with the set. Second, we present a novel system capable of efficiently solving the underlying counting problems required for quantitative reasoning. Our system exploits the graph-based measure treewidth by iteratively finding (graph) abstractions of ELPs.

## [732] Capturing Homomorphism-Closed Decidable Queries with Existential Rules (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Camille Bourgaux, David Carral, Markus Krötzsch, Sebastian Rudolph, Michaël Thomazo*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/733](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/733)

**Abstract**:

Existential rules are a very popular ontology-mediated query language for which the chase represents a generic computational approach for query answering. It is straightforward that existential rule queries exhibiting chase termination are decidable and can only recognize properties that are preserved under homomorphisms. 
This paper is an extended abstract of our eponymous publication at KR 2021 where we show the converse: every decidable query that is closed under homomorphism can be expressed by an existential rule set for which the standard chase universally terminates. Membership in this fragment is not decidable, but we show via a diagonalisation argument that this is unavoidable.

## [733] Deep Cooperation of CDCL and Local Search for SAT (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Shaowei Cai, Xindi Zhang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/734](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/734)

**Abstract**:

Modern SAT solvers are based on a paradigm named conflict driven clause learning (CDCL), while local search is an important alternative. Although there have been attempts combining these two methods, this work proposes deeper cooperation techniques. First, we relax the CDCL framework by extending  promising branches to complete assignments and calling a local search solver to search for a model nearby. More importantly, the local search assignments and the conflict frequency of variables in local search are exploited in the phase selection and branching heuristics of CDCL. We use our techniques to improve three typical CDCL solvers (glucose, MapleLCMDistChronoBT and Kissat). Experiments on  benchmarks from the Main tracks of SAT Competitions 2017-2020 and a real world benchmark of spectrum allocation show that the  techniques bring significant improvements, particularly on satisfiable instances.  A resulting solver won the Main Track SAT category in SAT Competition 2020 and also performs very well on the spectrum allocation benchmark. As far as we know, this is the first work that meets the standard of the  challenge  ``Demonstrate the successful combination of stochastic search and systematic search techniques, by the creation of a new algorithm that outperforms the best previous examples of both approaches.''

## [734] Scalable Anytime Planning for Multi-Agent MDPs (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Shushman Choudhury, Jayesh K. Gupta, Mykel J. Kochenderfer*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/735](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/735)

**Abstract**:

We present a scalable planning algorithm for multi-agent sequential decision problems that require dynamic collaboration.
Teams of agents need to coordinate decisions in many domains,
but naive approaches fail due to the exponential growth of the joint action space with the number of agents.
We circumvent this complexity through an anytime approach that allows us to trade computation for
approximation quality and also dynamically coordinate actions. 
Our algorithm comprises three elements: online planning with Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS), factorizing local agent interactions with coordination graphs, and
selecting optimal joint actions with the Max-Plus method.
On the benchmark SysAdmin domain with static coordination graphs, our approach achieves comparable performance with much lower computation cost than the MCTS baselines.
We also introduce a multi-drone delivery domain with dynamic, i.e., state-dependent coordination graphs, and demonstrate how our approach scales to large problems on this domain that are intractable for other MCTS methods.

## [735] Measuring Data Leakage in Machine-Learning Models with Fisher Information (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Awni Y. Hannun, Chuan Guo, Laurens van der Maaten*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/736](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/736)

**Abstract**:

Machine-learning models contain information about the data they were trained on. This information leaks either through the model itself or through predictions made by the model. Consequently, when the training data contains sensitive attributes, assessing the amount of information leakage is paramount. We propose a method to quantify this leakage using the Fisher information of the model about the data. Unlike the worst-case a priori guarantees of differential privacy, Fisher information loss measures leakage with respect to specific examples, attributes, or sub-populations within the dataset. We motivate Fisher information loss through the Cramer-Rao bound and delineate the implied threat model. We provide efficient methods to compute Fisher information loss for output-perturbed generalized linear models. Finally, we empirically validate Fisher information loss as a useful measure of information leakage.

## [736] Allocating Opportunities in a Dynamic Model of Intergenerational Mobility (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Hoda Heidari, Jon M. Kleinberg*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/737](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/737)

**Abstract**:

Opportunities such as higher education can promote intergenerational mobility, leading individuals to achieve levels of socioeconomic status above that of their parents. In this work, which is an extended abstract of a longer paper in the proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency, we develop a dynamic model for allocating such opportunities in a society that exhibits bottlenecks in mobility; the problem of optimal allocation reflects a trade-off between the benefits conferred by the opportunities in the current generation and the potential to elevate the socioeconomic status of recipients, shaping the composition of future generations in ways that can benefit further from the opportunities. We show how optimal allocations in our model arise as solutions to continuous optimization problems over multiple generations, and we find in general that these optimal solutions can favor recipients of low socioeconomic status over slightly higher-performing individuals of high socioeconomic status --- a form of socioeconomic affirmative action that the society in our model discovers in the pursuit of purely payoff-maximizing goals. We characterize how the structure of the model can lead to either temporary or persistent affirmative action, and we consider extensions of the model with more complex processes modulating the movement between different levels of socioeconomic status.

## [737] Homeomorphic-Invariance of EM: Non-Asymptotic Convergence in KL Divergence for Exponential Families via Mirror Descent (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Frederik Kunstner, Raunak Kumar, Mark Schmidt*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/738](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/738)

**Abstract**:

Expectation maximization (EM) is the default algorithm for fitting probabilistic models with missing or latent variables, yet we lack a full understanding of its non-asymptotic convergence properties. Previous works show results along the lines of “EM converges at least as fast as gradient descent” by assuming the conditions for the convergence of gradient descent apply. This approach is not only loose, in that it does not capture that EM can make more progress than a gradient step, but the assumptions fail to hold for textbook examples of EM like Gaussian mixtures. In this work, we show that for the common setting of exponential family distributions, viewing EM as a mirror descent algorithm leads to convergence rates in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and how the KL divergence is related to first-order stationarity via Bregman divergences. In contrast to previous works, the analysis is invariant to the choice of parametrization and holds with minimal assumptions. We also show applications of these ideas to local linear (and superlinear) convergence rates, generalized EM, and non-exponential family distributions.

## [738] Combining Clause Learning and Branch and Bound for MaxSAT (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Chu-Min Li, Zhenxing Xu, Jordi Coll, Felip Manyà, Djamal Habet, Kun He*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/739](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/739)

**Abstract**:

Branch and Bound (BnB) has been successfully used to solve many combinatorial optimization problems. However, BnB MaxSAT solvers perform poorly when solving real-world and academic optimization problems. They are only competitive for random and some crafted instances. Thus, it is a prevailing opinion in the community that BnB is not really useful for practical MaxSAT solving.
We refute this opinion by presenting a new BnB MaxSAT solver, called MaxCDCL, which combines clause learning and an efficient bounding procedure. MaxCDCL is among the top 5 out of a total of 15 exact solvers that participated in the 2020 MaxSAT Evaluation, solving several instances that other solvers cannot solve. Furthermore, MaxCDCL solves the highest number of instances from different MaxSAT Evaluations when combined with the best existing solvers.

**Abstract**:

We describe the deep learning-based COVID-19 cases predictor and the Pareto-optimal Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI) prescriptor developed by the winning team of the 500k XPRIZE Pandemic Response Challenge. The competition aimed at developing data-driven AI models to predict COVID-19 infection rates and to prescribe NPI Plans that governments, business leaders and organizations could implement to minimize harm when reopening their economies. In addition to the validation performed by XPRIZE with real data, our models were validated in a real-world scenario thanks to an ongoing collaboration with the Valencian Government in Spain. Our experience contributes to a necessary transition to more evidence-driven policy-making during a pandemic.

## [740] Complex Query Answering with Neural Link Predictors (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Pasquale Minervini, Erik Arakelyan, Daniel Daza, Michael Cochez*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/741](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/741)

**Abstract**:

Neural link predictors are useful for identifying missing edges in large scale Knowledge Graphs. However, it is still not clear how to use these models for answering more complex queries containing logical conjunctions (∧), disjunctions (∨), and existential quantifiers (∃). We propose a framework for efficiently answering complex queries on in- complete Knowledge Graphs. We translate each query into an end-to-end differentiable objective, where the truth value of each atom is computed by a pre-trained neural link predictor. We then analyse two solutions to the optimisation problem, including gradient-based and combinatorial search. In our experiments, the proposed approach produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods — black-box models trained on millions of generated queries — without the need for training on a large and diverse set of complex queries. Using orders of magnitude less training data, we obtain relative improvements ranging from 8% up to 40% in Hits@3 across multiple knowledge graphs. We find that it is possible to explain the outcome of our model in terms of the intermediate solutions identified for each of the complex query atoms. All our source code and datasets are available online (https://github.com/uclnlp/cqd).

## [741] Detect, Understand, Act: A Neuro-Symbolic Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Ludovico Mitchener, David Tuckey, Matthew Crosby, Alessandra Russo*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/742](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/742)

**Abstract**:

We introduce Detect, Understand, Act (DUA), a neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning framework. The Detect component is composed of a traditional computer vision object detector and tracker. The Act component houses a set of options, high-level actions enacted by pre-trained deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. The Understand component provides a novel answer set programming (ASP) paradigm for effectively learning symbolic meta-policies over options using inductive logic programming (ILP). We evaluate our framework on the Animal-AI (AAI) competition testbed, a set of physical cognitive reasoning problems. Given a set of pre-trained DRL policies, DUA requires only a few examples to learn a meta-policy that allows it to improve the state-of-the-art on multiple of the most challenging categories from the testbed. DUA constitutes the first holistic hybrid integration of computer vision, ILP and DRL applied to an AAI-like environment and sets the foundations for further use of ILP in complex DRL challenges.

## [742] Computationally Efficient Optimization of Plackett-Luce Ranking Models for Relevance and Fairness (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Harrie Oosterhuis*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/743](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/743)

**Abstract**:

Computing the gradient of stochastic Plackett-Luce (PL) ranking models for relevance and fairness metrics can be infeasible because it requires iterating over all possible permutations of items.
In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm: PL-Rank, that estimates the gradient of a PL ranking model through sampling. Unlike existing approaches, PL-Rank makes use of the specific structure of PL models and ranking metrics. Our experimental analysis shows that PL-Rank has a greater sample-efficiency and is computationally less costly than existing policy gradients, resulting in faster convergence at higher performance.

## [743] Logic Rules Meet Deep Learning: A Novel Approach for Ship Type Classification (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Manolis Pitsikalis, Thanh-Toan Do, Alexei Lisitsa, Shan Luo*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/744](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/744)

**Abstract**:

The shipping industry is an important component of the global trade and economy. In order to ensure law compliance and safety, it needs to be monitored. In this paper, we present a novel ship type classification model that combines vessel transmitted data from the Automatic Identification System, with vessel imagery. The main components of our approach are the Faster R-CNN Deep Neural Network and a Neuro-Fuzzy system with IF-THEN rules. We evaluate our model using real world data and showcase the advantages of this combination while also compare it with other methods. Results show that our model can increase prediction scores by up to 15.4% when compared with the next best model we considered, while also maintaining a level of explainability as opposed to common black box approaches.

## [744] Asymmetric Hybrids: Dialogues for Computational Concept Combination (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Guendalina Righetti, Daniele Porello, Nicolas Troquard, Oliver Kutz, Maria M. Hedblom, Pietro Galliani*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/745](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/745)

**Abstract**:

When considering two concepts in terms of extensional logic, their combination will often be trivial, returning an empty extension. Consider e.g. “a Fish Vehicle”, i.e., “a Vehicle which is also a Fish”. Still, people use sophisticated strategies to produce new, non-empty concepts. All these strategies involve the human ability to mend the conflicting attributes of the input concepts and to create new properties of the combination. We focus in particular on the case where a Head concept has superior ‘asymmetric’ control over steering the resulting combination (or hybridisation) with a Modifier concept. Specifically, we propose a dialogical model of the cognitive and logical mechanics of this asymmetric form of hybridisation. Its implementation is then evaluated using a combination of example ontologies.

## [745] Computing Programs for Generalized Planning as Heuristic Search (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Javier Segovia Aguas, Sergio Jiménez Celorrio, Anders Jonsson*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/746](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/746)

**Abstract**:

Although heuristic search is one of the most successful approaches to classical planning, this planning paradigm does not apply straightforwardly to Generalized Planning (GP).  This paper adapts the planning as heuristic search paradigm to the particularities of GP, and presents the first native heuristic search approach to GP. First, the paper defines a program-based solution space for GP that is independent of the number of planning instances in a GP problem, and the size of these instances. Second, the paper defines the BFGP algorithm for GP, that implements a best-first search in our program-based solution space, and that is guided by different evaluation and heuristic functions.

## [746] Towards Facilitating Empathic Conversations in Online Mental Health Support: A Reinforcement Learning Approach (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Ashish Sharma, Inna W. Lin, Adam S. Miner, Dave C. Atkins, Tim Althoff*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/747](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/747)

**Abstract**:

Online peer-to-peer support platforms enable conversations between millions of people who seek and provide mental health support. If successful, web-based mental health conversations could improve access to treatment and reduce the global disease burden. Psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that empathy, the ability to understand and feel the emotions and experiences of others, is a key component leading to positive outcomes in supportive conversations. However, recent studies have shown that highly empathic conversations are rare in online mental health platforms. 

In this paper, we work towards improving empathy in online mental health support conversations. We introduce a new task of empathic rewriting which aims to transform low-empathy conversational posts to higher empathy. Learning such transformations is challenging and requires a deep understanding of empathy while maintaining conversation quality through text fluency and specificity to the conversational context. Here we propose Partner, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to make sentence-level edits to posts in order to increase the expressed level of empathy while maintaining conversation quality. Our RL agent leverages a policy network, based on a transformer language model adapted from GPT-2, which performs the dual task of generating candidate empathic sentences and adding those sentences at appropriate positions. Through a combination of automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that Partner successfully generates more empathic, specific, and diverse responses and outperforms NLP methods from related tasks such as style transfer and empathic dialogue generation.

## [747] ProtoAI: Model-Informed Prototyping for AI-Powered Interfaces (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Hariharan Subramonyam, Colleen M. Seifert, Eytan Adar*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/748](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/748)

**Abstract**:

When prototyping AI experiences (AIX), interface designers seek effective ways to support end-user tasks through AI capabilities. However, AI poses challenges to design due to its dynamic behavior in response to training data, end-user data, and feedback. Designers must consider AI's uncertainties and offer adaptations such as explainability, error recovery, and automation vs. human task control. Unfortunately, current prototyping tools assume a black-box view of AI, forcing designers to work with separate tools to explore machine learning models, understand model performance, and align interface choices with model behavior. This introduces friction to rapid and iterative prototyping. We propose Model-Informed Prototyping (MIP), a workflow for AIX design that combines model exploration with UI prototyping tasks. Our system, ProtoAI, allows designers to directly incorporate model outputs into interface designs, evaluate design choices across different inputs, and iteratively revise designs by analyzing model breakdowns.

## [748] Black-box Audit of YouTube's Video Recommendation: Investigation of Misinformation Filter Bubble Dynamics (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Matús Tomlein, Branislav Pecher, Jakub Simko, Ivan Srba, Róbert Móro, Elena Stefancova, Michal Kompan, Andrea Hrckova, Juraj Podrouzek, Mária Bieliková*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/749](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/749)

**Abstract**:

In this paper, we describe a black-box sockpuppeting audit which we carried out to investigate the creation and bursting dynamics of misinformation filter bubbles on YouTube. Pre-programmed agents acting as YouTube users stimulated YouTube's recommender systems: they first watched a series of misinformation promoting videos (bubble creation) and then a series of misinformation debunking videos (bubble bursting). Meanwhile, agents logged videos recommended to them by YouTube. After manually annotating these recommendations, we were able to quantify the portion of misinformative videos among them. The results confirm the creation of filter bubbles (albeit not in all situations) and show that these bubbles can be bursted by watching credible content. Drawing a direct comparison with a previous study, we do not see improvements in overall quantities of misinformation recommended.

## [749] Unbiased Gradient Estimation in Unrolled Computation Graphs with Persistent Evolution Strategies (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Paul Vicol, Luke Metz, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/750](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/750)

**Abstract**:

Current approaches for optimizing parameters in unrolled computation graphs suffer from high variance gradients, bias, slow updates, or large memory usage. We introduce a method called Persistent Evolution Strategies (PES), which divides the computation graph into a series of truncated unrolls, and performs an evolution strategies-based update step after each unroll. PES eliminates bias from these truncations by accumulating correction terms over the entire sequence of unrolls. PES allows for rapid parameter updates, has low memory usage, is unbiased, and has reasonable variance.

**Abstract**:

We resolve the min-max complexity of distributed stochastic convex optimization (up to a log factor) in the intermittent communication setting, where M machines work in parallel over the course of R rounds of communication to optimize the objective, and during each round of communication, each machine may sequentially compute K stochastic gradient estimates. We present a novel lower bound with a matching upper bound that establishes an optimal algorithm.

## [751] Statistically-Guided Deep Network Transformation to Harness Heterogeneity in Space (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Yiqun Xie, Erhu He, Xiaowei Jia, Han Bao, Xun Zhou, Rahul Ghosh, Praveen Ravirathinam*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/752](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/752)

**Abstract**:

Spatial data are ubiquitous and have transformed decision-making in many critical domains, including public health, agriculture, transportation, etc. While recent advances in machine learning offer promising ways to harness massive spatial datasets (e.g., satellite imagery), spatial heterogeneity -- a fundamental property of spatial data -- poses a major challenge as data distributions or generative processes often vary over space. Recent studies targeting this difficult problem either require a known space-partitioning as the input, or can only support limited special cases (e.g., binary classification). Moreover, heterogeneity-pattern learned by these methods are locked to the locations of the training samples, and cannot be applied to new locations. We propose a statistically-guided framework to adaptively partition data in space during training using distribution-driven optimization and transform a deep learning model (of user's choice) into a heterogeneity-aware architecture. We also propose a spatial moderator to generalize learned patterns to new test regions. Experiment results on real-world datasets show that the framework can effectively capture footprints of heterogeneity and substantially improve prediction performances.

## [752] Including Signed Languages in Natural Language Processing (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Kayo Yin, Malihe Alikhani*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/753](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/753)

**Abstract**:

Signed languages are the primary means of communication for many deaf and hard of hearing individuals. Since signed languages exhibit all the fundamental linguistic properties of natural language, we believe that tools and theories of Natural Language Processing (NLP) are crucial towards its modeling. However, existing research in Sign Language Processing (SLP) seldom attempt to explore and leverage the linguistic organization of signed languages. This position paper calls on the NLP community to include signed languages as a research area with high social and scientific impact. We first discuss the linguistic properties of signed languages to consider during their modeling. Then, we review the limitations of current SLP models and identify the open challenges to extend NLP to signed languages. Finally, we urge (1) the adoption of an efficient tokenization method; (2) the development of linguistically-informed models; (3) the collection of real-world signed language data;  (4) the inclusion of local signed language communities as an active and leading voice in research.

## [753] Learning Discrete Representations via Constrained Clustering for Effective and Efficient Dense Retrieval (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Jingtao Zhan, Jiaxin Mao, Yiqun Liu, Jiafeng Guo, Min Zhang, Shaoping Ma*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/754](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/754)

**Abstract**:

Dense Retrieval (DR) has achieved state-of-the-art first-stage ranking effectiveness. However, the efficiency of most existing DR models is limited by the large memory cost of storing dense vectors and the time-consuming nearest neighbor search (NNS) in vector space. Therefore, we present RepCONC, a novel retrieval model that learns discrete Representations via CONstrained Clustering. RepCONC jointly trains dual-encoders and the Product Quantization (PQ) method to learn discrete document representations and enables fast approximate NNS with compact indexes. It models quantization as a constrained clustering process, which requires the document embeddings to be uniformly clustered around the quantization centroids. We theoretically demonstrate the importance of the uniform clustering constraint and derive an efficient approximate solution for constrained clustering by reducing it to an instance of the optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on two popular ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks show that RepCONC substantially outperforms a wide range of existing retrieval models in terms of retrieval effectiveness, memory efficiency, and time efficiency.

## [754] Rx-refill Graph Neural Network to Reduce Drug Overprescribing Risks (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Jianfei Zhang, Ai-Te Kuo, Jianan Zhao, Qianlong Wen, Erin L. Winstanley, Chuxu Zhang, Yanfang Ye*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/755](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/755)

**Abstract**:

Prescription (aka Rx) drugs can be easily overprescribed and lead to drug abuse or opioid overdose. Accordingly, a state-run prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP) in the United States has been developed to reduce overprescribing. However, PDMP has limited capability in detecting patients' potential overprescribing behaviors, impairing its effectiveness in preventing drug abuse and overdose in patients. In this paper, we propose a novel model RxNet, which builds 1) a dynamic heterogeneous graph to model Rx refills that are essentially prescribing and dispensing (P&D) relationships among various patients, 2) an RxLSTM network to explore the dynamic Rx-refill behavior and medical condition variation of patients, and 3) a dosing-adaptive network to extract and recalibrate dosing patterns and obtain the refined patient representations which are finally utilized for overprescribing detection. The extensive experimental results on a one-year state-wide PDMP data demonstrate that RxNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting patients at high risk of opioid overdose and drug abuse.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/756](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/756)

**Abstract**:

Allocating resources to individuals in a fair manner has been a topic of interest since the ancient times, with most of the early rigorous mathematical work on the problem focusing on infinitely divisible resources. Recently, there has been a surge of papers studying computational questions regarding various different notions of fairness for the indivisible case, like maximin share fairness (MMS) and envy-freeness up to any good (EFX). We survey the most important results in the discrete fair division literature, focusing on the case of additive valuation functions and paying particular attention to the progress made in the last 10 years.

## [756] Text Transformations in Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning: A Review

**Authors**: *Amrita Bhattacharjee, Mansooreh Karami, Huan Liu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/757](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/757)

**Abstract**:

Contrastive self-supervised learning has become a prominent technique in representation learning. The main step in these methods is to contrast semantically similar and dissimilar pairs of samples. However, in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the augmentation methods used in creating similar pairs with regard to contrastive learning (CL) assumptions are challenging. This is because, even simply modifying a word in the input might change the semantic meaning of the sentence, and hence, would violate the distributional hypothesis. In this review paper, we formalize the contrastive learning framework, emphasize the considerations that need to be addressed in the data transformation step, and review the state-of-the-art methods and evaluations for contrastive representation learning in NLP. Finally, we describe some challenges and potential directions for learning better text representations using contrastive methods.

## [757] A Survey on Word Meta-Embedding Learning

**Authors**: *Danushka Bollegala, James O'Neill*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/758](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/758)

**Abstract**:

Meta-embedding (ME) learning is an emerging approach that attempts to learn more accurate word embeddings given existing (source) word embeddings as the sole input.
  Due to their ability to incorporate semantics from multiple source embeddings in a compact manner with superior performance, ME learning has gained popularity among practitioners in NLP.
  To the best of our knowledge, there exist no prior systematic survey on ME learning and this paper
 attempts to fill this need.
  We classify ME learning methods according to multiple factors such as whether they 
  (a) operate on static or contextualised embeddings, (b) trained in an unsupervised manner or (c) fine-tuned for a particular task/domain.
  Moreover, we discuss the limitations of existing ME learning methods and highlight potential future research directions.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/759](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/759)

**Abstract**:

In the past few years, cross-modal image-text retrieval (ITR) has experienced increased interest in the research community due to its excellent research value and broad real-world application. It is designed for the scenarios where the queries are from one modality and the retrieval galleries from another modality. This paper presents a comprehensive and up-to-date survey on the ITR approaches from four perspectives. By dissecting an ITR system into two processes: feature extraction and feature alignment, we summarize the recent advance of the ITR approaches from these two perspectives. On top of this, the efficiency-focused study on the ITR system is introduced as the third perspective. To keep pace with the times, we also provide a pioneering overview of the cross-modal pre-training ITR approaches as the fourth perspective. Finally, we outline the common benchmark datasets and evaluation metric for ITR, and conduct the accuracy comparison among the representative ITR approaches. Some critical yet less studied issues are discussed at the end of the paper.

## [759] Evidential Reasoning and Learning: a Survey

**Authors**: *Federico Cerutti, Lance M. Kaplan, Murat Sensoy*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/760](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/760)

**Abstract**:

When collaborating with an artificial intelligence (AI) system, we need to assess when to trust its recommendations. Suppose we mistakenly trust it in regions where it is likely to err. In that case, catastrophic failures may occur, hence the need for Bayesian approaches for reasoning and learning to determine the confidence (or epistemic uncertainty) in the probabilities of the queried outcome. Pure Bayesian methods, however, suffer from high computational costs. To overcome them, we revert to efficient and effective approximations. In this paper, we focus on techniques that take the name of evidential reasoning and learning from the process of Bayesian update of given hypotheses based on additional evidence. This paper provides the reader with a gentle introduction to the area of investigation, the up-to-date research outcomes, and the open questions still left unanswered.

**Abstract**:

Following the success of pre-training techniques in the natural language domain, a flurry of table pre-training frameworks have been proposed and have achieved new state-of-the-arts on various downstream tasks such as table question answering, table type recognition, column relation classification, table search, and formula prediction. Various model architectures have been explored to best capture the characteristics of (semi-)structured tables, especially specially-designed attention mechanisms. Moreover, to fully leverage the supervision signals in unlabeled tables, diverse pre-training objectives have been designed and evaluated, for example, denoising cell values, predicting numerical relationships, and learning a neural SQL executor. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of model designs, pre-training objectives, and downstream tasks for table pre-training, and we further share our thoughts on existing challenges and future opportunities.

**Abstract**:

As transformer evolves, pre-trained models have advanced at a breakneck pace in recent years. They have dominated the mainstream techniques in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). How to adapt pre-training to the field of Vision-and-Language (V-L) learning and improve downstream task performance becomes a focus of multimodal learning. In this paper, we review the recent progress in Vision-Language Pre-Trained Models (VL-PTMs). As the core content, we first briefly introduce several ways to encode raw images and texts to single-modal embeddings before pre-training. Then, we dive into the mainstream architectures of VL-PTMs in modeling the interaction between text and image representations. We further present widely-used pre-training tasks, and then we introduce some common downstream tasks. We finally conclude this paper and present some promising research directions. Our survey aims to provide researchers with synthesis and pointer to related research.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/763](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/763)

**Abstract**:

Research in cognitive science has provided extensive evidence of human cognitive ability in performing physical reasoning of objects from noisy perceptual inputs. Such a cognitive ability is commonly known as intuitive physics. With advancements in deep learning, there is an increasing interest in building intelligent systems that are capable of performing physical reasoning from a given scene for the purpose of building better AI systems. As a result, many contemporary approaches in modelling intuitive physics for machine cognition have been inspired by literature from cognitive science. Despite the wide range of work in physical reasoning for machine cognition, there is a scarcity of reviews that organize and group these deep learning approaches. Especially at the intersection of intuitive physics and artificial intelligence, there is a need to make sense of the diverse range of ideas and approaches. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances and techniques in intuitive physics-inspired deep learning approaches for physical reasoning. The survey will first categorize existing deep learning approaches into three facets of physical reasoning before organizing them into three general technical approaches and propose six categorical tasks of the field. Finally, we highlight the challenges of the current field and present some future research directions.

**Abstract**:

Dialogue summarization aims to condense the original dialogue into a shorter version covering salient information, which is a crucial way to reduce dialogue data overload. Recently, the promising achievements in both dialogue systems and natural language generation techniques drastically lead this task to a new landscape, which results in significant research attentions. However, there still remains a lack of a comprehensive survey for this task. To this end, we take the first step and present a thorough review of this research field carefully and widely. In detail, we systematically organize the current works according to the characteristics of each domain, covering meeting, chat, email thread, customer service and medical dialogue. Additionally, we provide an overview of publicly available research datasets as well as organize two leaderboards under unified metrics. Furthermore, we discuss some future directions, including faithfulness, multi-modal, multi-domain and multi-lingual dialogue summarization, and give our thoughts respectively. We hope that this first survey of dialogue summarization can provide the community with a quick access and a general picture to this task and motivate future researches.

It focuses on surveying the work observing that DP systems may exacerbate bias and disparate impacts for different groups of individuals. The survey reviews the conditions under which privacy and fairness may be aligned or contrasting goals, analyzes how and why DP exacerbates bias and unfairness in decision problems and learning tasks, and reviews the available solutions to mitigate the fairness issues arising in DP systems. The survey provides a unified understanding of the main challenges and potential risks arising when deploying privacy-preserving machine learning or decisions making tasks under a fairness lens.

**Abstract**:

Multi-party conversations (MPCs) are a more practical and challenging scenario involving more than two interlocutors. This research topic has drawn significant attention from both academia and industry, and it is nowadays counted as one of the most promising research areas in the field of dialogue systems. In general, MPC algorithms aim at addressing the issues of Who says What to Whom, specifically, who speaks, say what, and address whom. The complicated interactions between interlocutors, between utterances, and between interlocutors and utterances develop many variant tasks of MPCs worth investigation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of recent advances in text-based MPCs. In particular, we first summarize recent advances on the research of MPC context modeling including dialogue discourse parsing, dialogue flow modeling and self-supervised training for MPCs. Then we review the state-of-the-art models categorized by Who says What to Whom in MPCs. Finally, we highlight the challenges which are not yet well addressed in MPCs and present future research directions.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/769](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/769)

**Abstract**:

Modern Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) require significant memory to store weight, activations, and other intermediate tensors during training. Hence, many models donâ€™t fit one GPU device or can be trained using only a small per-GPU batch size. This survey provides a systematic overview of the approaches that enable more efficient DNNs training. We analyze techniques that save memory and make good use of computation and communication resources on architectures with a single or several GPUs. We summarize the main categories of strategies and compare strategies within and across categories. Along with approaches proposed in the literature, we discuss available implementations.

**Authors**: *Minghuan Liu, Menghui Zhu, Weinan Zhang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/770](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/770)

**Abstract**:

Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL), related to a set of complex RL problems, trains an agent to achieve different goals under particular scenarios. Compared to the standard RL solutions that learn a policy solely depending on the states or observations, GCRL additionally requires the agent to make decisions according to different goals.
In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and algorithms for GCRL. Firstly, we answer what the basic problems are studied in this field. Then, we explain how goals are represented and present how existing solutions are designed from different points of view. Finally, we make the conclusion and discuss potential future prospects that recent researches focus on.

**Authors**: *Weiwen Liu, Yunjia Xi, Jiarui Qin, Fei Sun, Bo Chen, Weinan Zhang, Rui Zhang, Ruiming Tang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/771](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/771)

**Abstract**:

As the final stage of the multi-stage recommender system (MRS), re-ranking directly affects usersâ€™ experience and satisfaction by rearranging the input ranking lists, and thereby plays a critical role in MRS. With the advances in deep learning, neural re-ranking has become a trending topic and been widely adopted in industrial applications. This review aims at integrating re-ranking algorithms into a broader picture, and paving ways for more comprehensive solutions for future research. For this purpose, we first present a taxonomy of current methods on neural re-ranking. Then we give a description of these methods along with the historic development according to their objectives. The network structure, personalization, and complexity are also discussed and compared. Next, we provide a benchmark for the major neural re-ranking models and quantitatively analyze their re-ranking performance. Finally, the review concludes with a discussion on future prospects of this field. A list of papers discussed in this review, the benchmark datasets, our re-ranking library LibRerank, and detailed parameter settings are publicly available at https://github.com/LibRerank-Community/LibRerank.

**Authors**: *Xin Liu, Mingyu Yan, Lei Deng, Guoqi Li, Xiaochun Ye, Dongrui Fan, Shirui Pan, Yuan Xie*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/772](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/772)

**Abstract**:

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been a hot spot of recent research and are widely utilized in diverse applications. However, with the use of huger data and deeper models, an urgent demand is unsurprisingly made to accelerate GNNs for more efficient execution. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on acceleration methods for GNNs from an algorithmic perspective. We first present a new taxonomy to classify existing acceleration methods into five categories. Based on the classification, we systematically discuss these methods and highlight their correlations. Next, we provide comparisons from aspects of the efficiency and characteristics of these methods. Finally, we suggest some promising prospects for future research.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/773](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/773)

**Abstract**:

Pretrained models have produced great success in both Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). This progress leads to learning joint representations of vision and language pretraining by feeding visual and linguistic contents into a multi-layer transformer, Visual-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs). In this paper, we present an overview of the major advances achieved in VLPMs for producing joint representations of vision and language. As the preliminaries, we briefly describe the general task definition and genetic architecture of VLPMs. We first discuss the language and vision data encoding methods and then present the mainstream VLPM structure as the core content. We further summarise several essential pretraining and fine-tuning strategies. Finally, we highlight three future directions for both CV and NLP researchers to provide insightful guidance.

## [773] Predictive Coding: Towards a Future of Deep Learning beyond Backpropagation?

**Authors**: *Beren Millidge, Tommaso Salvatori, Yuhang Song, Rafal Bogacz, Thomas Lukasiewicz*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/774](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/774)

**Abstract**:

The backpropagation of error algorithm (BP) used to train deep neural networks has been fundamental to the successes of deep learning. However, it requires sequential backwards updates and non-local computations which make it challenging to parallelize at scale and is unlike how learning works in the brain. Neuroscience-inspired learning algorithms, however, such as \emph{predictive coding} which utilize local learning have the potential to overcome these limitations and advance beyond deep learning technologies in the future. While predictive coding originated in theoretical neuroscience as a model of information processing in the cortex, recent work has developed the idea into a general-purpose algorithm  able to train neural networks using only local computations. In this survey, we review works that have contributed to this perspective and demonstrate the close connection between predictive coding and backpropagation in terms of generalization quality, as well as works that highlight the multiple advantages of using predictive coding models over backprop-trained neural networks. Specifically, we show the substantially greater flexibility of  predictive coding networks against equivalent deep neural networks, which can function as classifiers, generators, and associative memories simultaneously, and can be defined on arbitrary graph topologies. Finally, we  review direct benchmarks of predictive coding networks on machine learning classification tasks, as well as its close connections to control theory and applications in robotics.

## [775] Evaluation Methods for Representation Learning: A Survey

**Authors**: *Kento Nozawa, Issei Sato*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/776](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/776)

**Abstract**:

Representation learning enables us to automatically extract generic feature representations from a dataset to solve another machine learning task. Recently, extracted feature representations by a representation learning algorithm and a simple predictor have exhibited state-of-the-art performance on several machine learning tasks. Despite its remarkable progress, there exist various ways to evaluate representation learning algorithms depending on the application because of the flexibility of representation learning. To understand the current applications of representation learning, we review evaluation methods of representation learning algorithms. On the basis of our evaluation survey, we also discuss the future direction of representation learning. The extended version, https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08226, gives more detailed discussions and a survey on theoretical analyses.

Here, we present a unified theoretical view of relational machine learning models which can address these tasks. We provide fundamental definitions, compare existing model architectures and discuss performance metrics, datasets, and evaluation protocols. In addition, we emphasize possible high-impact applications and important future research directions in this domain.

**Abstract**:

Over the last few years, the Shapley value, a solution concept from cooperative game theory, has found numerous applications in machine learning. In this paper, we first discuss fundamental concepts of cooperative game theory and axiomatic properties of the Shapley value. Then we give an overview of the most important applications of the Shapley value in machine learning: feature selection, explainability, multi-agent reinforcement learning, ensemble pruning, and data valuation. We examine the most crucial limitations of the Shapley value and point out directions for future research.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/779](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/779)

**Abstract**:

As the body of research on machine narrative comprehension grows, there is a critical need for consideration of performance assessment strategies as well as the depth and scope of different benchmark tasks. Based on narrative theories, reading comprehension theories, as well as existing machine narrative reading comprehension tasks and datasets, we propose a typology that captures the main similarities and differences among assessment tasks; and discuss the implications of our typology for new task design and the challenges of narrative reading comprehension.

**Abstract**:

We characterise the problem of abstraction in the context of deep reinforcement learning. Various well established approaches to analogical reasoning and associative memory might be brought to bear on this issue, but they present difficulties because of the need for end-to-end differentiability. We review developments in AI and machine learning that could facilitate their adoption.

## [780] Detecting and Understanding Harmful Memes: A Survey

**Authors**: *Shivam Sharma, Firoj Alam, Md. Shad Akhtar, Dimitar Dimitrov, Giovanni Da San Martino, Hamed Firooz, Alon Y. Halevy, Fabrizio Silvestri, Preslav Nakov, Tanmoy Chakraborty*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/781](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/781)

**Abstract**:

The automatic identification of harmful content online is of major concern for social media platforms, policymakers, and society. Researchers have studied textual, visual, and audio content, but typically in isolation. Yet, harmful content often combines multiple modalities, as in the case of memes. With this in mind, here we offer a comprehensive survey with a focus on harmful memes. Based on a systematic analysis of recent literature, we first propose a new typology of harmful memes, and then we highlight and summarize the relevant state of the art. One interesting finding is that many types of harmful memes are not really studied, e.g., such featuring self-harm and extremism, partly due to the lack of suitable datasets. We further find that existing datasets mostly capture multi-class scenarios, which are not inclusive of the affective spectrum that memes can represent. Another observation is that memes can propagate globally through repackaging in different languages and that they can also be multilingual, blending different cultures. We conclude by highlighting several challenges related to multimodal semiotics, technological constraints, and non-trivial social engagement, and we present several open-ended aspects such as delineating online harm and empirically examining related frameworks and assistive interventions, which we believe will motivate and drive future research.

## [781] Data Valuation in Machine Learning: "Ingredients", Strategies, and Open Challenges

**Authors**: *Rachael Hwee Ling Sim, Xinyi Xu, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/782](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/782)

**Abstract**:

Data valuation in machine learning (ML) is an emerging research area that studies the worth of data in ML. Data valuation is used in collaborative ML to determine a fair compensation for every data owner and in interpretable ML to identify the most responsible, noisy, or misleading training examples. This paper presents a comprehensive technical survey that provides a new formal study of data valuation in ML through its “ingredients” and the corresponding properties, grounds the discussion of common desiderata satisfied by existing data valuation strategies on our proposed ingredients, and identifies open research challenges for designing new ingredients, data valuation strategies, and cost reduction techniques.

## [782] Problem Compilation for Multi-Agent Path Finding: a Survey

**Authors**: *Pavel Surynek*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/783](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/783)

**Abstract**:

Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) attracts considerable attention in artificial intelligence community. The task in the standard MAPF is to find discrete paths through which agents can navigate from their starting positions to individual goal positions. The combination of two additional requirements makes the problem computationally challenging: agents must not collide with each other and the paths must be optimal with respect to some objective. Two major approaches to optimal MAPF solving include dedicated search-based methods, and compilation-based methods that reduce a MAPF instance to an instance in a different formalism, for which an efficient solver exists.  In this survey, we summarize major compilation-based solvers for MAPF using CSP, SAT, and MILP formalisms. We explain the core ideas of the solvers in a simplified and unified way while preserving the merit making them more accessible for a wider audience.

## [783] A Survey of Risk-Aware Multi-Armed Bandits

**Authors**: *Vincent Y. F. Tan, Prashanth L. A., Krishna P. Jagannathan*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/784](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/784)

**Abstract**:

In several applications such as clinical trials and financial portfolio optimization, the expected value (or the average reward) does not satisfactorily capture the merits of a drug or a portfolio. In such applications, risk plays a crucial role, and a risk-aware performance measure is preferable, so as to capture losses in the case of adverse events. This survey aims to consolidate and summarise the existing research on risk measures, specifically in the context of multi-armed bandits. We review various risk measures of interest, and comment on their properties. Next, we review existing concentration inequalities for various risk measures. Then, we proceed to defining risk-aware bandit problems, We consider algorithms for the regret minimization setting, where the exploration-exploitation tradeoff manifests, as well as the best arm identification setting, which is a pure exploration problemâ€”both in the context of risk-sensitive measures. We conclude by commenting on persisting challenges and fertile areas for future research.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/785](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/785)

**Abstract**:

This survey targets intention and trajectory prediction in Autonomous Vehicles (AV), as AV companies compete to create dedicated prediction pipelines to avoid collisions. The survey starts with a formal definition of the prediction problem and highlights its challenges, to then critically compare the models proposed in the last 2-3 years in terms of how they overcome these challenges. Further, it lists the latest methodological and technical trends in the field and comments on the efficacy of different machine learning blocks in modelling various aspects of the prediction problem. It also summarises the popular datasets and metrics used to evaluate prediction models, before concluding with the possible research gaps and future directions.

## [785] Recent Advances on Neural Network Pruning at Initialization

**Authors**: *Huan Wang, Can Qin, Yue Bai, Yulun Zhang, Yun Fu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/786](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/786)

**Abstract**:

Neural network pruning typically removes connections or neurons from a pretrained converged model; while a new pruning paradigm, pruning at initialization (PaI), attempts to prune a randomly initialized network. This paper offers the first survey concentrated on this emerging pruning fashion. We first introduce a generic formulation of neural network pruning, followed by the major classic pruning topics. Then, as the main body of this paper, a thorough and structured literature review of PaI methods is presented, consisting of two major tracks (sparse training and sparse selection). Finally, we summarize the surge of PaI compared to PaT and discuss the open problems. Apart from the dedicated literature review, this paper also offers a code base for easy sanity-checking and benchmarking of different PaI methods.

## [786] On the Opportunity of Causal Learning in Recommendation Systems: Foundation, Estimation, Prediction and Challenges

**Authors**: *Peng Wu, Haoxuan Li, Yuhao Deng, Wenjie Hu, Quanyu Dai, Zhenhua Dong, Jie Sun, Rui Zhang, Xiao-Hua Zhou*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/787](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/787)

**Abstract**:

Recently, recommender system (RS) based on causal inference has gained much attention in the industrial community, as well as the states of the art performance in many prediction and debiasing tasks. Nevertheless, a unified causal analysis framework has not been established yet. Many causal-based prediction and debiasing studies rarely discuss the causal interpretation of various biases and the rationality of the corresponding causal assumptions. In this paper, we first provide a formal causal analysis framework to survey and unify the existing causal-inspired recommendation methods, which can accommodate different scenarios in RS. Then we propose a new taxonomy and give formal causal definitions of various biases in RS from the perspective of violating the assumptions adopted in causal analysis. Finally, we formalize many debiasing and prediction tasks in RS, and summarize the statistical and machine learning-based causal estimation methods, expecting to provide new research opportunities and perspectives to the causal RS community.

## [787] Recent Advances in Concept Drift Adaptation Methods for Deep Learning

**Authors**: *Liheng Yuan, Heng Li, Beihao Xia, Cuiying Gao, Mingyue Liu, Wei Yuan, Xinge You*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/788](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/788)

**Abstract**:

In the ``Big Data'' age, the amount and distribution of data have increased wildly and changed over time in various time-series-based tasks, e.g weather prediction, network intrusion detection. However, deep learning models may become outdated facing variable input data distribution, which is called concept drift. To address this problem, large number of samples are usually required to update deep learning models, which is impractical in many realistic applications. This challenge drives researchers to explore the effective ways to adapt deep learning models to concept drift. In this paper, we first mathematically describe the categories of concept drift including abrupt drift, gradual drift, recurrent drift, incremental drift. We then divide existing studies into two categories (i.e., model parameter updating and model structure updating), and analyze the pros and cons of representative methods in each category.  Finally, we evaluate the performance of these methods, and point out the future directions of concept drift adaptation for deep learning.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/789](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/789)

**Abstract**:

Graph representation learning has attracted tremendous attention due to its remarkable performance in many real-world applications. However, prevailing supervised graph representation learning models for specific tasks often suffer from label sparsity issue as data labeling is always time and resource consuming. In light of this, few-shot learning on graphs (FSLG), which combines the strengths of graph representation learning and few-shot learning together, has been proposed to tackle the performance degradation in face of limited annotated data  challenge. There have been many studies working on FSLG recently. In this paper, we comprehensively survey these work in the form of a series of methods and applications. Specifically, we first introduce FSLG challenges and bases, then categorize and summarize existing work of FSLG in terms of three major graph mining tasks at different granularity levels, i.e., node, edge, and graph. Finally, we share our thoughts on some future research directions of FSLG. The authors of this survey have contributed significantly to the AI literature on FSLG over the last few years.

**Abstract**:

In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received extensive attention in brain-inspired intelligence due to their rich spatially-temporal dynamics, various encoding methods, and event-driven characteristics that naturally fit the neuromorphic hardware. With the development of SNNs, brain-inspired intelligence, an emerging research field inspired by brain science achievements and aiming at artificial general intelligence, is becoming hot. This paper reviews recent advances and discusses new frontiers in SNNs from five major research topics, including essential elements (i.e., spiking neuron models, encoding methods, and topology structures), neuromorphic datasets, optimization algorithms, software, and hardware frameworks. We hope our survey can help researchers understand SNNs better and inspire new works to advance this field.

## [790] A Survey on Gradient Inversion: Attacks, Defenses and Future Directions

**Authors**: *Rui Zhang, Song Guo, Junxiao Wang, Xin Xie, Dacheng Tao*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/791](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/791)

**Abstract**:

Recent studies have shown that the training samples can be recovered from gradients, which are called Gradient Inversion (GradInv) attacks. However, there remains a lack of extensive surveys covering recent advances and thorough analysis of this issue. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on GradInv, aiming to summarize the cutting-edge research and broaden the horizons for different domains. Firstly, we propose a taxonomy of GradInv attacks by characterizing existing attacks into two paradigms: iteration- and recursion-based attacks. In particular, we dig out some critical ingredients from the iteration-based attacks, including data initialization, model training and gradient matching. Second, we summarize emerging defense strategies against GradInv attacks. We find these approaches focus on three perspectives covering data obscuration, model improvement and gradient protection. Finally, we discuss some promising directions and open problems for further research.

## [791] Towards Verifiable Federated Learning

**Authors**: *Yanci Zhang, Han Yu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/792](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/792)

**Abstract**:

Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm of collaborative machine learning that preserves user privacy while building powerful models. Nevertheless, due to the nature of open participation by self-interested entities, it needs to guard against potential misbehaviours by legitimate FL participants. FL verification techniques are promising solutions for this problem. They have been shown to effectively enhance the reliability of FL networks and build trust among participants. Verifiable FL has become an emerging topic of research that has attracted significant interest from the academia and the industry alike. Currently, there is no comprehensive survey on the field of verifiable federated learning, which is interdisciplinary in nature and can be challenging for researchers to enter into. In this paper, we bridge this gap by reviewing works focusing on verifiable FL. We propose a novel taxonomy for verifiable FL covering both centralised and decentralised settings, summarise the commonly adopted performance evaluation approaches, and discuss promising directions towards a versatile verifiable FL framework.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/793](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/793)

**Abstract**:

Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) facilitates domain-independent discovery of relational facts from large corpora. The technique well suits many open-world natural language understanding scenarios, such as automatic knowledge base construction, open-domain question answering, and explicit reasoning. Thanks to the rapid development in deep learning technologies, numerous neural OpenIE architectures have been proposed and achieve considerable performance improvement. In this survey, we provide an extensive overview of the state-of-the-art neural OpenIE models,  their key design decisions, strengths and weakness. Then, we discuss limitations of current solutions and the open issues in OpenIE problem itself. Finally we list recent trends that could help expand its scope and applicability, setting up promising directions for future research in OpenIE. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first review on neural OpenIE.

## [794] Bayesian Auctions with Efficient Queries (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Jing Chen, Bo Li, Yingkai Li, Pinyan Lu*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/795](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/795)

**Abstract**:

Designing dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) mechanisms for a seller to generate (approximately) optimal revenue by selling items to players is a fundamental problem in Bayesian mechanism design. However, most existing studies assume that the seller knows the entire distribution from which the players’ values are drawn. Unfortunately, this assumption may not hold in reality: for example, when the distributions have exponentially large supports or do not have succinct representations. In this work we consider, for the first time, the query complexityof Bayesian mechanisms. The seller only has limited oracle accesses to the players’ distributions, via quantile queriesand value queries. For single-item auctions, we design mechanisms with logarithmicnumber of value or quantile queries which achieve almost optimal revenue. We then prove logarithmic lower-bounds, i.e., logarithmic number of queries are necessary for any constant approximation DSIC mechanisms, even when randomized and adaptive queries are allowed. Thus our mechanisms are almost optimal regarding query complexity. Our lower-bounds can be extended to multi-item auctions with monotone subadditive valuations, and we complement this part with constant approximation mechanisms for unit-demand or additive valuation functions. Our results are robust even if the answers to the queries contain noises.

## [795] Overlapping Communities and Roles in Networks with Node Attributes: Probabilistic Graphical Modeling, Bayesian Formulation and Variational Inference (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Gianni Costa, Riccardo Ortale*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/796](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/796)

**Abstract**:

We study the seamless integration of community discovery and behavioral role analysis, in the domain of networks with node attributes. In particular, we focus on unifying the two tasks, by explicitly harnessing node attributes and behavioral role patterns in a principled manner. To this end, we propose two Bayesian probabilistic generative models of networks, whose novelty consists in the interrelationship of overlapping communities, roles, their behavioral patterns and node attributes. The devised models allow for a variety of exploratory, descriptive and predictive tasks. These are carried out through mean-field variational inference, which is in turn mathematically derived and implemented into a coordinate-ascent algorithm.
		
A wide spectrum of experiments is designed, to validate the devised models against three classes of state-of-the-art competitors using various real-world benchmark data sets from different social networking services.

## [796] On Quantifying Literals in Boolean Logic and its Applications to Explainable AI (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Adnan Darwiche, Pierre Marquis*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/797](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/797)

**Abstract**:

Quantified Boolean logic results from adding operators to Boolean logic for existentially and universally quantifying variables. This extends the reach of Boolean logic by enabling a variety of applications that have been explored over the decades. The existential quantification of literals (variable states) and its applications have also been studied in the literature. We complement this by studying universal literal quantification and its applications, particularly to explainable AI. We also provide a novel semantics for quantification and discuss the interplay between variable/literal and existential/universal quantification. We further identify classes of Boolean formulas and circuits that allow efficient quantification. Literal quantification is more fine-grained than variable quantification, which leads to a refinement of quantified Boolean logic with literal quantification as its primitive.

## [797] Situation Calculus for Controller Synthesis in Manufacturing Systems with First-Order State Representation (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Giuseppe De Giacomo, Paolo Felli, Brian Logan, Fabio Patrizi, Sebastian Sardiña*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/798](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/798)

**Abstract**:

Manufacturing is transitioning from a mass production model to a service model in which facilities `bid' for previously unseen products. To decide whether to bid for a previously unseen product, a facility must be able to synthesize, on the fly, a process plan controller that delegates abstract manufacturing tasks in a supplied process recipe to the available manufacturing resources. First-order representations of the state are commonly considered in reasoning about action in AI. Here we show that we can leverage the wide literature on the Situation Calculus automatically synthesize such controllers. We identify two important decidable cases---finite domains and bounded action theories---for which we provide practical synthesis techniques.

## [798] Making Sense of Raw Input (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Richard Evans, Matko Bosnjak, Lars Buesing, Kevin Ellis, David Pfau, Pushmeet Kohli, Marek J. Sergot*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/799](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/799)

**Abstract**:

How should a machine intelligence perform unsupervised structure discovery over streams of sensory input? One approach to this problem is to cast it as an apperception task. Here, the task is to construct an explicit interpretable theory that both explains the sensory sequence and also satisfies a set of  unity conditions, designed to ensure that the constituents of the theory are connected in a relational structure. 

However, the original formulation of the apperception task had one fundamental limitation: it assumed the raw sensory input had already been parsed using a set of discrete categories, so that all the system had to do was receive this already-digested symbolic input, and make sense of it. But what if we don't have access to pre-parsed input? What if our sensory sequence is raw unprocessed information?

The central contribution of this paper is a neuro-symbolic framework for distilling interpretable theories out of streams of raw, unprocessed sensory experience.
First, we extend the definition of the apperception task to include ambiguous (but still symbolic) input: sequences of sets of disjunctions. Next, we use a neural network to map raw sensory input to disjunctive input. Our binary neural network is encoded as a logic program, so the weights of the network and the rules of the theory can be solved jointly as a single SAT problem. This way, we are able to jointly learn how to perceive (mapping raw sensory information to concepts) and apperceive (combining concepts into declarative rules).

## [799] Abstraction in Data-Sparse Task Transfer (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Tesca Fitzgerald, Ashok K. Goel, Andrea Thomaz*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/800](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/800)

**Abstract**:

When a robot adapts a learned task for a novel environment, any changes to objects in the novel environment have an unknown effect on its task execution. For example, replacing an object in a pick-and-place task affects where the robot should target its actions, but does not necessarily affect the underlying action model. In contrast, replacing a tool that the robot will use to complete a task will effectively alter its end-effector pose with respect to the robot's base coordinate system, and thus the robot's motion must be replanned accordingly. 

These examples highlight the relationship among (i) differences between the source and target environments, (ii) the level of abstraction at which a robot's task model should be represented to enable transfer to the target environment, and (iii) the information needed to ground the abstracted task representation in the target environment. In this abstract, summarizing our full article [Fitzgerald et al., 2021], we present our taxonomy of transfer problems based on this relationship. We also describe a knowledge representation called the Tiered Task Abstraction (TTA) and demonstrate its applicability to a variety of transfer problems in the taxonomy. Our experimental results indicate a trade-off between the generality and data requirements of a task representation, and reinforce the need for multiple transfer methods that operate at different levels of abstraction.
