**Abstract**:

The existence of an anomaly detection method that is optimal for all domains is a myth. Thus, there exists a plethora of anomaly detection methods which increases every year for a wide variety of domains. But a strength can also be a weakness; given this massive library of methods, how can one select the best method for their application? Current literature is focused on creating new anomaly detection methods or large frameworks for experimenting with multiple methods at the same time. However, and especially as the literature continues to expand, an extensive evaluation of every anomaly detection method is simply not feasible. To reduce this evaluation burden, we present guidelines to intelligently choose the optimal anomaly detection methods based on the characteristics the time series displays such as seasonality, trend, level change concept drift, and missing time steps. We provide a comprehensive experimental validation and survey of twelve anomaly detection methods over different time series characteristics to form guidelines based on several metrics: the AUC (Area Under the Curve), windowed F-score, and Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) scoring model. Applying our methodologies can save time and effort by surfacing the most promising anomaly detection methods instead of experimenting extensively with a rapidly expanding library of anomaly detection methods, especially in an online setting.

## [801] Dimensional Inconsistency Measures and Postulates in Spatio-Temporal Databases (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *John Grant, Maria Vanina Martinez, Cristian Molinaro, Francesco Parisi*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/802](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/802)

**Abstract**:

We define and investigate new inconsistency measures that are particularly suitable for dealing with inconsistent spatio-temporal information, as they explicitly take into account the spatial and temporal dimensions, as well as the dimension concerning the identifiers of the monitored objects. Specifically, we first define natural measures that look at individual dimensions (time, space, and objects), and then propose measures based on the notion of a repair. We then analyze their behavior w.r.t. common postulates defined for classical propositional knowledge bases, and find that the latter are not suitable for spatio-temporal databases, in that the proposed inconsistency measures do not often satisfy them. In light of this, we argue that also postulates should explicitly take into account the spatial, temporal, and object dimensions, and thus define ``dimension-aware'' counterparts of common postulates, which are indeed often satisfied by the new inconsistency measures. Finally, we study the complexity of the proposed inconsistency measures.

## [802] Local and Global Explanations of Agent Behavior: Integrating Strategy Summaries with Saliency Maps (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Tobias Huber, Katharina Weitz, Elisabeth André, Ofra Amir*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/803](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/803)

**Abstract**:

With advances in reinforcement learning (RL), agents are now being developed in high-stakes application domains such as healthcare and transportation. Explaining the behavior of these agents is challenging, as they act in large state spaces, and their decision-making can be affected by delayed rewards. In this paper, we explore a combination of explanations that attempt to convey the global behavior of the agent and local explanations which provide information regarding the agent's decision-making in a particular state. Specifically, we augment strategy summaries that demonstrate the agent's actions in a range of states with saliency maps highlighting the information it attends to. Our user study shows that intelligently choosing what states to include in the summary (global information) results in an improved analysis of the agents. We find mixed results with respect to augmenting summaries with saliency maps (local information).

## [803] sunny-as2: Enhancing SUNNY for Algorithm Selection (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Tong Liu, Roberto Amadini, Maurizio Gabbrielli, Jacopo Mauro*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/804](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/804)

**Abstract**:

SUNNY is a k-nearest neighbors based Algorithm Selection (AS) approach that schedules and runs a number of solvers for a given unforeseen problem. In this work we present sunny-as2, an enhancement of SUNNY for generic AS scenarios that advances the original approach with wrapper-based feature selection, neighborhood-size configuration and a greedy approach to speed-up the training phase. Empirical evidence shows that sunny-as2 is competitive w.r.t. state-of-the-art AS approaches.

## [804] Intelligence in Strategic Games (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Pavel Naumov, Yuan Yuan*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/805](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/805)

**Abstract**:

If an agent, or a coalition of agents, has a strategy, knows that she has a strategy, and knows what the strategy is, then she has a know-how strategy. Several modal logics of coalition power for know-how strategies have been studied before. 

The contribution of the article is three-fold. First, it proposes a new class of know-how strategies that depend on the intelligence information about the opponents' actions. Second, it shows that the coalition power modality for the proposed new class of strategies cannot be expressed through the standard know-how modality. Third, it gives a sound and complete logical system that describes the interplay between the coalition power modality with intelligence and the distributed knowledge modality in games with imperfect information.

## [805] Learning Realistic Patterns from Visually Unrealistic Stimuli: Generalization and Data Anonymization (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Konstantinos Nikolaidis, Stein Kristiansen, Thomas Plagemann, Vera Goebel, Knut Liestøl, Mohan S. Kankanhalli, Gunn Marit Traaen, Britt Øverland, Harriet Akre, Lars Aakerøy, Sigurd Steinshamn*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/806](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/806)

**Abstract**:

Good training data is a prerequisite to develop useful Machine Learning applications. However, in many domains existing data sets  cannot be shared due to privacy regulations (e.g., from medical studies). This work investigates a simple yet unconventional approach for anonymized data synthesis to enable third parties to benefit from such anonymized data. We explore the feasibility of learning implicitly from visually unrealistic, task-relevant stimuli, which are synthesized by exciting the neurons of a  trained  deep neural network. As such, neuronal excitation can be used to generate synthetic stimuli.  The stimuli data is used to train new classification models. Furthermore, we extend this framework to inhibit representations that are associated with specific individuals. Extensive comparative empirical investigation  shows that different algorithms trained on the stimuli are able to generalize successfully on  the same task as the original model.

## [806] Abstraction for Non-Ground Answer Set Programs (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Zeynep G. Saribatur, Thomas Eiter, Peter Schüller*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/807](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/807)

**Abstract**:

Abstraction is a powerful technique that has not been considered much for nonmonotonic reasoning formalisms including Answer Set Programming (ASP), apart from related simplification methods. We introduce a notion for abstracting from the domain of an ASP program that shrinks the domain size and over-approximates the set of answer sets, as well as an abstraction-&-refinement methodology that, starting from an initial abstraction, automatically yields an abstraction with an associated answer set matching an answer set of the original program if one exists. Experiments reveal the potential of the approach, by its ability to focus on the program parts that cause unsatisfiability and by achieving concrete abstract answer sets that merely reflect relevant details.

## [807] A Theoretical Perspective on Hyperdimensional Computing (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Anthony Thomas, Sanjoy Dasgupta, Tajana Rosing*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/808](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/808)

**Abstract**:

Hyperdimensional (HD) computing is a set of neurally inspired methods for computing on high-dimensional, low-precision, distributed representations of data. These representations can be combined with simple, neurally plausible algorithms to effect a variety of information processing tasks. HD computing has recently garnered significant interest from the computer hardware community as an energy-efficient, low-latency, and noise-robust tool for solving learning problems. We present a novel mathematical framework that unifies analysis of HD computing architectures, and provides general, non-asymptotic, sufficient conditions under which HD information processing techniques will succeed.

## [808] Measuring the Occupational Impact of AI: Tasks, Cognitive Abilities and AI Benchmarks (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Songül Tolan, Annarosa Pesole, Fernando Martínez-Plumed, Enrique Fernández-Macías, José Hernández-Orallo, Emilia Gómez*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/809](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/809)

**Abstract**:

We present a framework for analysing the impact of AI on occupations. This framework maps 59 generic tasks from different occupational datasets to 14 cognitive abilities and these to  a comprehensive list of 328 AI benchmarks used to evaluate research intensity in AI. The use of cognitive abilities as an intermediate layer allows for an identification of potential AI exposure for tasks for which AI applications have not been explicitly programmed. We provide insights into the abilities through which AI is most likely to affect jobs, and we show how some of the abilities where AI research is currently very intense are linked to tasks with comparatively limited labour input in the labour markets of advanced economies.

## [809] Why Bad Coffee? Explaining BDI Agent Behaviour with Valuings (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Michael Winikoff, Galina Sidorenko, Virginia Dignum, Frank Dignum*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/810](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/810)

**Abstract**:

An important issue in deploying an autonomous system is how to enable human users and stakeholders to develop an appropriate level of trust in the system. It has been argued that a crucial mechanism to enable appropriate trust is the ability of a system to explain its behaviour. Obviously, such explanations need to be comprehensible to humans. Due to the perceived similarity in functioning between humans and autonomous systems, we argue that it makes sense to build on the results of extensive research in social sciences that explores how humans explain their behaviour. Using similar concepts for explanation is argued to help with comprehensibility, since the concepts are familiar. Following work in the social sciences, we propose the use of a folk-psychological model that utilises beliefs, desires, and ``valuings''. We propose a formal framework for constructing explanations of the behaviour of an autonomous system, present an (implemented) algorithm for giving explanations, and present evaluation results.

## [810] Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence: A Survey of Machine Learning Researchers (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Baobao Zhang, Markus Anderljung, Lauren Kahn, Noemi Dreksler, Michael C. Horowitz, Allan Dafoe*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/811](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/811)

**Abstract**:

Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) researchers play an important role in the ethics and governance of AI, including through their work, advocacy, and choice of employment. Nevertheless, this influential group's attitudes are not well understood, undermining our ability to discern consensuses or disagreements between AI/ML researchers. To examine these researchers' views, we conducted a survey of those who published in two top AI/ML conferences (N = 524). We compare these results with those from a 2016 survey of AI/ML researchers and a 2018 survey of the US public. We find that AI/ML researchers place high levels of trust in international organizations and scientific organizations to shape the development and use of AI in the public interest; moderate trust in most Western tech companies; and low trust in national militaries, Chinese tech companies, and Facebook. While the respondents were overwhelmingly opposed to AI/ML researchers working on lethal autonomous weapons, they are less opposed to researchers working on other military applications of AI, particularly logistics algorithms. A strong majority of respondents think that AI safety research should be prioritized more and a majority that ML institutions should conduct pre-publication review to assess potential harms. Being closer to the technology itself, AI/ML researchers are well placed to highlight new risks and develop technical solutions, so this novel data has broad relevance. The findings should help to improve how researchers, private sector executives, and policymakers think about regulations, governance frameworks, guiding principles, and national and international governance strategies for AI.

## [811] Improving the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Stochastic Neighbour Embedding with Isolation Kernel (Extended Abstract)

**Authors**: *Ye Zhu, Kai Ming Ting*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/812](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/812)

**Abstract**:

This paper presents a new insight into improving the performance of Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) by using Isolation kernel instead of Gaussian kernel. We show that Isolation kernel addresses two deficiencies of t-SNE that employs Gaussian kernel, and the use of Isolation kernel enables t-SNE to deal with large-scale datasets in less runtime without trading off accuracy, unlike existing methods used in speeding up t-SNE.

## [812] Irrational, but Adaptive and Goal Oriented: Humans Interacting with Autonomous Agents

**Authors**: *Amos Azaria*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/813](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/813)

**Abstract**:

Autonomous agents that interact with humans are becoming more and more prominent.
Currently, such agents usually take one of the following approaches for considering human behavior. Some methods assume either a fully cooperative or a zero-sum setting; these assumptions entail that the human's goals are either identical to that of the agent, or their opposite. In both cases, the agent is not required to explicitly model the human’s goals and account for humans' adaptation nature. 
Other methods first compose a model of human behavior based on observing human actions, and then optimize the agent’s actions based on this model. Such methods do not account for how the human will react to the agent's actions and thus, suffer an overestimation bias.
Finally, other methods, such as model free reinforcement learning, merely learn which actions the agent should take at which states. While such methods can, theoretically, account for human adaptation nature, since they require extensive interaction with humans, they usually run in simulation.
By not considering the human’s goals, autonomous agents act selfishly, lack generalization, require vast amounts of data, and cannot account for human’s strategic behavior. Therefore, we call for pursuing solution concepts for autonomous agents interacting with humans that consider the human’s goals and adaptive nature.

## [813] Analyzing and Designing Strategic Environments in Social Domains

**Authors**: *Hau Chan*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/814](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/814)

**Abstract**:

The cross-fertilization of AI and economic concepts has led to the advanced development of novel computational ideas. These ideas include models and approaches for analyzing multi-agent interaction (via game-theoretic models and solution concepts) in strategic environments and designing strategic environments (via mechanism design) to address principal decision-making problems involving multi-agent within various social contexts. In what follows, we will discuss our works on these two main topics. For analyzing multi-agent interaction, we will discuss several computational game-theoretic models to capture various agent characteristics and social (e.g., self-organization) domains. For designing strategic environments, we will discuss principal decision-making mechanism design settings in various social (e.g., facility location) contexts where the principal has to design mechanisms that elicit agent preferences over social outcomes and implement the principal's desirable social outcomes.

Collective decisions among human and artificial agents can be enhanced by allowing for more interaction among decision-makers and by letting them express more information about their preferences.
In this paper I present ongoing research on two settings: iterative voting, which repeatedly applies a voting rule until decision-makers converge to an outcome, and delegative voting on multiple issues.

## [816] Counting, Sampling, and Synthesis: The Quest for Scalability

**Authors**: *Kuldeep S. Meel*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/817](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/817)

**Abstract**:

The current generation of symbolic reasoning techniques excel at the qualitative tasks (i.e., when the answer is Yes or No); such techniques sufficed for traditional systems whose design sought to achieve deterministic behavior. In contrast, modern computing systems crucially rely on the statistical methods to account for the uncertainty in the environment, and to reason about behavior of these systems, there is need to look beyond qualitative symbolic reasoning techniques. We will discuss our work focused on the development of the  next generation of automated reasoning techniques that can perform higher-order tasks such as quantitative measurement, sampling of representative behavior, and automated synthesis of  systems.  


From a core technical perspective, our work builds on the SAT revolution, which refers to algorithmic advances in combinatorial solving techniques for the fundamental problem of 
satisfiability (SAT), i.e., whether it is possible to satisfy a given set of constraints. The SAT revolution offers the opportunity to develop scalable techniques for problems that lie beyond SAT from complexity perspective and, therefore, stand to benefit from the availability of powerful SAT engines. 
Our work seeks to enable a  Beyond SAT revolution via design of scalable techniques for three fundamental problems that lie beyond SAT:
 constrained counting, constrained sampling, and   automated synthesis.

## [817] Controllable Text Generation for Open-Domain Creativity and Fairness

**Authors**: *Nanyun (Violet) Peng*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/818](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/818)

**Abstract**:

Recent advances in large pre-trained language models have demonstrated strong results in generating natural languages and significantly improved performances for many natural language generation (NLG) applications such as machine translation and text summarization. However, when the generation tasks are more open-ended and the content is under-specified, existing techniques struggle to generate long-term coherent and creative content. Moreover, the models exhibit and even amplify social biases that are learned from the training corpora. This happens because the generation models are trained to capture the surface patterns (i.e. sequences of words), instead of capturing underlying semantics and discourse structures, as well as background knowledge including social norms. In this paper, I introduce our recent works on controllable text generation to enhance the creativity and fairness of language generation models. We explore hierarchical generation and constrained decoding, with applications to creative language generation including story, poetry, and figurative languages, and bias mitigation for generation models.

## [818] Towards Theoretically Grounded Evolutionary Learning

**Authors**: *Chao Qian*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/819](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/819)

**Abstract**:

Machine learning tasks are often formulated as complex optimization problems, where the objective function can be non-differentiable, non-continuous, non-unique, inaccurate, dynamic, and have many local optima, making conventional optimization algorithms fail. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), inspired by Darwin's theory of evolution, are general-purpose randomized heuristic optimization algorithms, mimicking variational reproduction and natural selection. EAs have yielded encouraging outcomes for solving complex optimization problems (e.g., neural architecture search) in machine learning. However, due to the heuristic nature of EAs, most outcomes to date have been empirical and lack theoretical support, encumbering their acceptance to the general machine learning community. In this paper, I will review the progress towards theoretically grounded evolutionary learning, from the aspects of analysis methodology, theoretical perspectives and learning algorithms. Due to space limit, I will include a few representative examples and highlight our contributions. I will also discuss some future challenges.

## [819] Mechanism Design Powered by Social Interactions: A Call to Arms

**Authors**: *Dengji Zhao*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/820](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/820)

**Abstract**:

Mechanism design has traditionally assumed that the participants are fixed and independent. However, in reality, the participants are well-connected (e.g., via their social networks) and we can utilize their connections to power the design. One interesting trend is to incentivize the existing participants to use their connections to invite new participants. This helps to form larger games in auctions, coalitional games, matching etc., which is not achievable with the traditional solutions. The challenge is that the participants are competitors and they would not invite each other by default. Solving this is well-coupled with the existing challenges. For example, in auctions, solving it may require revenue monotonicity and false-name-proofness, which were proved impossible to achieve under certain sensible conditions. In matching, this cannot get along with standard optimality and stability. Hence, we believe there is an important theoretical value to discover and the study will stimulate many interesting applications, especially under decentralized systems with blockchain.

## [820] Towards New Optimized Artificial Immune Recognition Systems under the Belief Function Theory

**Authors**: *Rihab Abdelkhalek*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/821](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/821)

**Abstract**:

Artificial Immune Recognition Systems (AIRS) are powerful machine learning techniques, which aim to solve real world problems. A number of AIRS versions have produced successful prediction results. Nevertheless, these methods are unable to handle the uncertainty that could spread out at any stage of the AIRS approach. This issue is considered as a huge obstacle for having accurate and effective classification outputs. Therefore, our main objective is to handle this uncertainty using the belief function theory. We opt also in this article for an optimization over the classical AIRS approaches in order to enhance the classification performance.

## [821] Extending Decision Tree to Handle Multiple Fairness Criteria

**Authors**: *Alessandro Castelnovo*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/822](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/822)

**Abstract**:

The demand for machine learning systems that can provide both transparency and fairness is constantly growing. Since the concept of fairness depends on the context, studies in the literature have proposed various formalisation and mitigation strategies. In this work, we propose a novel, flexible, discrimination-aware classifier that allows the user to: (i) select and mitigate the desired fairness criterion from a set of available options; (ii) implement more than one fairness criterion; (iii) handle more than one sensitive attribute; and (iv) specify the desired level of fairness to meet specific business needs or regulatory requirements. Our approach is based on an optimised extension to the decision-tree classifier, and aims to provide transparent and fair rules to the final users.

**Abstract**:

Adequate annotated data cannot always be satisfied in medical imaging applications. To address such a challenge, we would explore ways to reduce the quality and quantity of annotations requirements of the deep learning model by developing a hybrid learning system. We combined self-supervised learning, semi-supervised learning and weak-supervised learning to improve annotation utilization. Our primary research work on 2D medical image detection under poor annotation conditions has found that better regularization and adversarial loss can improve the robustness and performance with poor annotation conditions.

## [824] KRAKEN: A Novel Semantic-Based Approach for Keyphrases Extraction

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/825](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/825)

**Abstract**:

We propose KRAKEN, a novel approach for the extraction of keyphrases from texts. To this aim, KRAKEN makes use of distributional semantics to identify, as completely as possible, representative portions of documents, i.e. keyphrases. In addition, we define novel metrics to assess a weighted significance to the keyphrases extracted from a document, identifying the most important ones by assessing their semantic similarity with the text of the document they belong to.

## [825] Building a Visual Semantics Aware Object Hierarchy

**Authors**: *Xiaolei Diao*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/826](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/826)

**Abstract**:

The semantic gap is defined as the difference between the linguistic representations of the same concept, which usually leads to misunderstanding between individuals with different knowledge backgrounds. Since linguistically annotated images are extensively used for training machine learning models, semantic gap problem (SGP) also results in inevitable bias on image annotations and further leads to poor performance on current computer vision tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel unsupervised method to build visual semantics aware object hierarchy, aiming to get a classification model by learning from pure-visual information and to dissipate the bias of linguistic representations caused by SGP. Our intuition in this paper comes from real-world knowledge representation where concepts are hierarchically organized, and each concept can be described by a set of features rather than a linguistic annotation, namely visual semantic. The evaluation consists of two parts, firstly we apply the constructed hierarchy on the object recognition task and then we compare our visual hierarchy and existing lexical hierarchies to show the validity of our method. The preliminary results reveal the efficiency and potential of our proposed method.

The Ph.D research project aims to explore the potential of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization paradigm in conjunction with classic software architectures for Artificial Intelligence applications. The intended goal is to investigate and formalize a possible integration path between Multi-agent System architectures and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations. Starting from the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents standards, we will extend basic primitives to integrate Multi-agent Systems on Distributed Ledger Technology networks. Possible deployment of services and applications in the Internet-of-Things, Artificial Intelligence and Distributed Machine Learning areas will be tested. Application of Data Analysis techniques on datasets built on such a framework will be also addressed.

## [828] A Unified Framework for Intrinsic Evaluation of Word-Embedding Algorithms

**Authors**: *Anna Giabelli*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/829](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/829)

**Abstract**:

Word embeddings are widely used in copious Natural Language Processing tasks, including semantic analysis, information retrieval, dependency parsing, question answering, and machine translation. This extensive use implies that the evaluation of the performance of such representations is crucial for choosing the best model to perform those tasks.

Though there are well-established procedures and benchmarks for intrinsic evaluation, as far as we know, a unified method of evaluation that can merge the results of those tasks to provide a comprehensive evaluation is missing. The main goal of this work is to create a pipeline to blend all major intrinsic evaluation tasks to compute such overall evaluation - the PCE - of word embeddings.

**Authors**: *Benjamin Kovács*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/831](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/831)

**Abstract**:

The goal of this work is to develop novel methods to solve the semiconductor fab scheduling problem. The problem can be modeled as a flexible job-shop with large instances and specific constraints related to special machine and job characteristics. To investigate the problem, we develop a tool to simulate small to large-scale instances of the problem. Using the simulator, we aim to develop new dispatching strategies using genetic programming and reinforcement learning.

## [832] Engineering Socially-Oriented Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems

**Authors**: *Nieves Montes*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/833](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/833)

**Abstract**:

The emergent field of social AI is concerned with the development of autonomous agents that are able to act as part of larger community. Within this context, my research seeks to engineer meaningful social interactions among a group of agents from two different approaches. First, the societal level leverages constructs that apply to a society as a whole, like norms and social values. Second, the individual level endows agents with the ability to reason about others, by making use of Theory of Mind capabilities.

## [833] Application of Neurosymbolic AI to Sequential Decision Making

**Authors**: *Carlos Núñez-Molina*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/834](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/834)

**Abstract**:

In the history of AI, two main paradigms have been proposed to solve Sequential Decision Making (SDM) problems: Automated Planning (AP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Among the many proposals to unify both fields, the one known as neurosymbolic AI has recently attracted great attention. It combines the Deep Neural Networks used in modern RL with the symbolic representations typical of AP. The main goal of this PhD is to progress the state of the art in neurosymbolic AI for SDM, developing methods for both solving these problems and learning aspects of their structure.

## [834] Multivariate Times Series Classification Using Multichannel CNN

**Authors**: *YongKyung Oh*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/835](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/835)

**Abstract**:

Multivariate time series classification is an important and demanding task in sequence data mining. We focus on the multichannel representation of the time series and its corresponding convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier. The proposed method transforms multivariate time series into multichannel analogous image and it is fed into a pretrained multichannel CNN with transfer learning. To verify the efficacy of the proposed method, we compared it with recent deep learning-based time series classification models on five datasets with small amounts of training data. The results indicate that the proposed method provides improved performance on average compared with the other methods when incorporated with transfer learning.

## [835] Anchors Selection for Cross-lingual Embedding Alignment through Time

**Authors**: *Filippo Pallucchini*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/836](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/836)

**Abstract**:

In recent years, vector representations of words have proven to be extremely useful across a wide range of NLP applications. Because of the broad interest in the topic, it became essential to answer the following question: is it possible to align different embeddings, in order to compare terms belonging to different vector spaces and their relations? While embedding alignment received considerable attention in the literature, how to find the best anchors for this process is still an open problem; in this paper, we propose an unsupervised, automatic method to select words belonging to different corpora that are close from a semantic point of view, and can be used as anchors for aligning their respective embedding spaces.

## [836] Transferability and Stability of Learning with Limited Labelled Data in Multilingual Text Document Classification

**Authors**: *Branislav Pecher*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/837](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/837)

**Abstract**:

We focus on learning with limited labelled data (especially meta-learning) in conjunction with so-far under-researched multilingual textual document classification. The core principle in such learning is to achieve transferability of learned knowledge to new datasets and tasks. Currently, factors influencing the success of transfer remain mostly unclear. Their identification from experiments is challenging due to small amounts of labels making results considerably unstable. When instability of the investigated models is not explicitly taken into consideration (as is common in existing benchmarking studies), it may result in randomness possibly even invalidating the findings. We want to remedy this by in-depth exploration of factors that influence the stability and the transferability of learning with limited labelled data in multilingual textual documents classification, such as misinformation detection.

## [837] Towards Contextually Sensitive Analysis of Memes: Meme Genealogy and Knowledge Base

**Authors**: *Victoria Sherratt*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/838](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/838)

**Abstract**:

As online communication grows, memes have continued to evolve and circulate as succinct multimodal forms of communication. However, computational approaches applied to meme-related tasks lack the same depth and contextual sensitivity of non-computational approaches and struggle to interpret intra-modal dynamics and referentiality. This research proposes to a ‘meme genealogy’ of key features and relationships between memes to inform a knowledge base constructed from meme-specific online sources and embed connotative meaning or contextual information in memes. The proposed methods provide a basis to train contextually sensitive computational models for analysing memes and applications in semi-automated meme annotation.

## [838] Data-Efficient Algorithms and Neural Natural Language Processing: Applications in the Healthcare Domain

**Authors**: *Heereen Shim*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/839](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/839)

**Abstract**:

Recently proposed pre-trained language models can be easily fine-tuned to a wide range of downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning requires a large training set. This PhD project introduces novel natural language processing (NLP) use cases in the healthcare domain where obtaining a large training dataset is difficult and expensive. To this end, we propose data-efficient algorithms to fine-tune NLP models in low-resource settings and validate their effectiveness. We expect the outcomes of this PhD project could contribute to the NLP research and low-resource application domains.

## [839] A Model-Oriented Approach for Lifting Symmetry-Breaking Constraints in Answer Set Programming

**Authors**: *Alice Tarzariol*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/840](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/840)

**Abstract**:

Writing correct models for combinatorial problems is relatively straightforward; however, they must be efficient to be usable with instances producing many solution candidates. 
In this work, we aim to automatically generalise the discarding of symmetric solutions of Answer Set Programming instances, improving the efficiency of the programs with first-order constraints derived from propositional symmetry-breaking constraints.

## [840] Adaptive Artificial Intelligence Scheduling Methods for Large-Scale, Stochastic, Industrial Applications

**Authors**: *Pierre Tassel*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/841](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/841)

**Abstract**:

Traditional scheduling techniques suffer from a lack of flexibility. 
The problem's instances need to be deterministic, and results on datasets with small benchmark instances do usually not transfer to large-scale instances. 
We propose to develop adaptive algorithms that can leverage the similarities between instances of industrial scheduling problems. 
In particular, we focus on applications of modern machine learning techniques to combinatorial optimization problems, an emerging and promising research area. 
Traditional scheduling techniques such as constraint, mixed-integer, or answer set programming are highly generic, domain-independent, and, therefore, do not explicitly exploit the specificities of a problem domain. 
However, in a production facility, the settings between two consecutive schedules are often very similar.
The machines, workers, production capacity, etc., usually stay the same or do not change significantly.
Traditional scheduling techniques do not take advantage of such similarities, while machine learning, especially deep learning, can discover and exploit relationships in the data. 
Therefore, our research aims to incorporate machine learning into combinatorial optimization.

## [841] Information Injection to Deep Learning Solutions in Knowledge Transfer

**Authors**: *Paulina Tomaszewska*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/842](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/842)

**Abstract**:

Nowadays, with the thrive of AutoML techniques, it is expected that Machine Learning algorithms will work well without any human intervention. This is why the biggest focus is on introducing new neural network architectures, especially those capable of learning to learn. Recently, the Data-Centric AI Challenge was proposed by Andrew Ng whose goal was to change the paradigm and instead of having a fixed dataset and modifying the model, now the model is fixed and the data is preprocessed so that the model results in the best performance. In my thesis, I would like to focus on another approach, where I would not modify the given data nor introduce new architectures, instead, I would like to propose new ways of injecting additional information into knowledge transfer models to increase their performance.

## [842] Automatic Multimodal Emotion Recognition Using Facial Expression, Voice, and Text

**Authors**: *Hélène Tran*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/843](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/843)

**Abstract**:

It has been a long-time dream for humans to interact with a machine as we would with a person, in a way that it understands us, advises us, and looks after us with no human supervision. Despite being efficient on logical reasoning, current advanced systems lack empathy and user understanding. Estimating the user's emotion could greatly help the machine to identify the user's needs and adapt its behaviour accordingly. This research project aims to develop an automatic emotion recognition system based on facial expression, voice, and words. We expect to address the challenges related to multimodality, data complexity, and emotion representation.

## [843] Anomaly Explanation

**Authors**: *Véronne Yepmo*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/844](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/844)

**Abstract**:

With the surge of deep learning and laws aiming at regulating the use of artificial intelligence, providing explanations to algorithms outputs has been a hot topic in the recent years. Most works are devoted to the explanation of classifiers outputs. The explanation of unsupervised machine learning algorithms, like anomaly detection, has received less attention from the XAI community. But this little interest is not imputable to the irrelevance of the topic. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of anomaly explanation, the areas still needing investigation based upon our previous contributions to the field, and the future directions that will be explored.

## [844] Diffusion Incentives in Cooperative Games

**Authors**: *Yao Zhang*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/845](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/845)

**Abstract**:

We study a cooperative game setting where we want to gather more players through their social connections. Social connections can be modeled as a graph, and initially, only a subset of the players are in the game. We want to introduce diffusion incentives in such a cooperative game, i.e., incentivize the players to use their connections to invite more players to join the game. Our goal cannot be achieved by existing classical solutions, such as the Shapley value. Hence, to combat this problem, we have already proposed a solution called weighted permission Shapley value. Under this solution, for each player, inviting all of her neighbors is a dominant strategy in all monotone games. As one special application of the diffusion cooperative game, we also considered the diffusion incentives in query networks and the weighted permission Shapley value successfully characterizes the solution to the query network. Furthermore, we also characterize a Sybil-proof solution to the query network called the double geometric mechanism.

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/846](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/846)

**Abstract**:

We present ``Together about Dementia'', a mobile health app
   that aims to help persons with dementia when they get lost through
   the help of caregivers, relatives, and volunteering
   citizens. When the app detects that a person with dementia is
   disoriented, wandering, and getting lost, it triggers an alarm that
   activates a relative and possibly a volunteer in the proximity. A
   backend system based on a microservice and serverless architecture
   performs the detection of wandering and the subsequent coordination
   of users that are put on a mission to the rescue of the person with
   dementia. The backend system implements an AI technique for
   spatio-temporal anomaly detection based on location data recorded by
   the frontend system installed on the portable device of the person
   with dementia.

## [846] Displaying Justifications for Collective Decisions

**Authors**: *Arthur Boixel, Ulle Endriss, Oliviero Nardi*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/847](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/847)

**Abstract**:

We present an online demonstration tool illustrating a general approach to computing justifications for accepting a given decision when confronted with the preferences of several agents. Such a justification consists of a set of axioms providing a normative basis for the decision, together with a step-by-step explanation of how those axioms determine the decision. Our open-source implementation may also prove useful for realising other kinds of projects in computational social choice, particularly those requiring access to a SAT solver.

## [847] Itero: An Online Iterative Voting Application

**Authors**: *Joseph Boudou, Rachael Colley, Umberto Grandi*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/848](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/848)

**Abstract**:

Iterative voting allows a group of agents to take a collective decision in a dynamic fashion: a series of plurality elections are staged, making the relative scores of the candidates public after each round. Voters can thus adjust their ballots at each step until the process converges (or a maximal number of steps is reached). 
Research in computational social choice has shown that this method has the potential of reaching good-quality decisions while at the same time being easy to explain to voters. This paper presents our implementation of iterative voting on a voting platform accessible on the web.

## [848] Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression from Multi-Format Human-Preference Feedbacks

**Authors**: *Laure Crochepierre, Lydia Boudjeloud-Assala, Vincent Barbesant*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/849](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/849)

**Abstract**:

In this work, we propose an interactive platform to perform grammar-guided symbolic regression using a reinforcement learning approach from human-preference feedback. To do so, a reinforcement learning algorithm iteratively generates symbolic expressions, modeled as trajectories constrained by grammatical rules, from which a user shall elicit preferences. The interface gives the user three distinct ways of stating its preferences between multiple sampled symbolic expressions: categorizing samples, comparing pairs, and suggesting improvements to a sampled symbolic expression. Learning from preferences enables users to guide the exploration in the symbolic space toward regions that are more relevant to them. We provide a web-based interface testable on symbolic regression benchmark functions and power system data.

**Abstract**:

We present a toolkit for knowledge-based news event analysis and forecasting. The toolkit is powered by a Knowledge Graph (KG) of events curated from structured and unstructured sources of event-related knowledge. The toolkit provides functions for 1) mapping ongoing news headlines to concepts in the KG, 2) retrieval, reasoning, and visualization for causal analysis and forecasting, and 3) extraction of causal knowledge from text documents to augment the KG with additional domain knowledge. Each function has a number of implementations using a wide range of state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic techniques. We show how the toolkit enables building a human-in-the-loop explainable solution for event analysis and forecasting.

## [850] CARBEN: Composite Adversarial Robustness Benchmark

**Authors**: *Lei Hsiung, Yun-Yun Tsai, Pin-Yu Chen, Tsung-Yi Ho*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/851](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/851)

**Abstract**:

Prior literature on adversarial attack methods has mainly focused on attacking with and defending against a single threat model, e.g., perturbations bounded in Lp ball. However, multiple threat models can be combined into composite perturbations. One such approach, composite adversarial attack (CAA), not only expands the perturbable space of the image, but also may be overlooked by current modes of robustness evaluation. This paper demonstrates how CAA's attack order affects the resulting image, and provides real-time inferences of different models, which will facilitate users' configuration of the parameters of the attack level and their rapid evaluation of model prediction. A leaderboard to benchmark adversarial robustness against CAA is also introduced.

**Abstract**:

Sign language is the communication language used in hearing impaired community. Recently, the research of sign language production has made great progress but still need to cope with some critical challenges. In this paper, we propose a system-level scheme and push forward the implementation of sign language production for practical usage. We build a system capable of translating speech into sign language avatar. Different from previous approach only focusing on single technology, we systematically combine algorithms of language translation, body gesture animation and facial avatar generation. We also develop two applications: Sign Language Interpretation APP and Virtual Sign Language Anchor, to facilitate easy and clear communication for hearing impaired people.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/853](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/853)

**Abstract**:

Responsible integration of deep neural networks into the design of trustworthy systems requires the ability to explain decisions made by these models. Explainability and transparency are critical for system analysis, certification, and human-machine teaming. We have recently demonstrated that neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) present an explanation-friendly DNN  architecture. In this paper, we present ExplainIt, an online tool for explaining AI decisions that uses neural SDEs to create visually sharper and more robust attributions than traditional residual neural networks. Our tool shows that the injection of noise in every layer of a residual network often leads to less noisy and less fragile integrated gradient attributions. The discrete neural stochastic differential equation model is trained on the ImageNet data set with a million images, and the demonstration produces robust attributions on images in the ImageNet validation library and on a variety of images in the wild. Our online tool is hosted publicly for educational purposes.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/854](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/854)

**Abstract**:

Safety of taking medicine prescribed differently to each patient in hospital relies on the discernment of medical professionals who deals with measuring pill quantity, packaging, and distributing. It is difficult and time consuming to keep track of medication record of each patient. Also, medication safety is prone to be in risk due to the human error. To help patients get accurate medication following their prescription plan with minimizing human labors and mistakes, we developed PillGood, an automated smart pill dispenser system using facial recognition technique. PillGood provides real-time and personalized guidance to take the correct medicine by alarming patients and distributing exact quantity of pills at specific time following each patient's prescription table. The system notify patients through mobile app and speaker when they need to take the medicine, and detect who the patient is through the machine learning based face recognition. Then, based on each patient's prescribing information, the controller distributes pills to each patient. Results show that PillGood enable highly accurate personalized pill dispensation followed by precise face recognition, benefiting both patients and medical professionals. Videos for demonstrating the system can be found on  https://youtu.be/Wx7bXxRGjXA

**Abstract**:

Through this paper, we seek to reduce the communication barrier between the hearing-impaired community and the larger society who are usually not familiar with sign language in the sub-Saharan region of Africa with the largest occurrences of hearing disability cases, while using Nigeria as a case study. The dataset is a pioneer dataset for the Nigerian Sign Language and was created in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. We pre-processed the data in readiness for two different object detection models and a classification model and employed diverse evaluation metrics to gauge model performance on sign-language to text conversion tasks. Finally, we convert the predicted sign texts to speech and deploy the best performing model in a lightweight application that works in real-time and achieves impressive results converting sign words/phrases to text and subsequently, into speech.

**Abstract**:

In the last few years, we have been witnessing the increasing deployment of machine learning-based systems, which act as black boxes whose behaviour is hidden to end-users. As a side-effect, this contributes to increasing the need for explainable methods and tools to support the coordination between humans and ML models towards collaborative decision-making. In this paper, we demonstrate ContrXT, a novel tool that computes the differences in the classification logic of two distinct trained models, reasoning on their symbolic representation through Binary Decision Diagrams.
ContrXT is available as a pip package and API.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/859](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/859)

**Abstract**:

Evidence-based medicine aims at making decisions about the care of individual patients based on the explicit use of the best available evidence in the patient clinical history and the medical literature results. Argumentation represents a natural way of addressing this task by (i) identifying evidence and claims in text, and (ii) reasoning upon the extracted
arguments and their relations to make a decision. ACTA 2.0 is an automated tool which relies on Argument Mining methods to analyse the abstracts of clinical trials to extract argument components and relations to support evidence-based clinical decision making. ACTA 2.0 allows also for the identification of PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) elements, and the analysis of the effects of an intervention on the outcomes of the study. A REST API is also provided to exploit the toolâ€™s functionalities.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/860](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/860)

**Abstract**:

Virtual machine (VM) scheduling is one of the critical tasks in cloud computing. Many works have attempted to incorporate machine learning, especially reinforcement learning, to empower VM scheduling procedures. Although improved results are shown in several demo simulators, the performances in real-world scenarios are still underexploited. In this paper, we design a practical VM scheduling platform, i.e., VMAgent, to assist researchers in developing their methods on the VM scheduling problem. VMAgent consists of three components: simulator, scheduler, and visualizer. The simulator abstracts three general realistic scheduling scenarios (fading, recovering, and expansion) based on Huawei Cloudâ€™s scheduling data, which is the core of our platform. Flexible configurations are further provided to make the simulator compatible with practical cloud computing architecture (i.e., Multi Non-Uniform Memory Access) and scenarios. Researchers then need to instantiate the scheduler to interact with the simulator, which is also pre-built in various types (e.g., heuristic, machine learning, and operations research) of scheduling algorithms to speed up the algorithm design. The visualizer, as an auxiliary component of the simulator and scheduler, facilitates researchers to conduct an in-depth analysis of the scheduling procedure and comprehensively compare different scheduling algorithms. We believe that VMAgent would shed light on the AI for the VM scheduling community, and the demo video is presented in https://bit.ly/vmagent-demo-video.

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/861](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/861)

**Abstract**:

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved excellent results currently in classification, while they may still suffer from ambiguous images which are similar across classes. By contrast, humans have a relatively good ability to distinguish these categories of images. Therefore, we propose a human-in-the-loop solution to assist the network to better classify the images by leveraging human knowledge. To achieve this, we project the high-dimensional latent space trained by the network onto a two-dimensional workspace. The users can interactively modify the projected coordinates of inputs on the workspace using our designed tools, then the modified information will be fed back to the network to fine-tune it, which in turn affects the network's classification results, thereby improving the accuracy of network classification.

**Abstract**:

Action recognition is an important task for video understanding with broad applications. However, developing an effective action recognition solution often requires extensive engineering efforts in building and testing different combinations of the modules and their hyperparameters. In this demo, we present AutoVideo, a Python system for automated video action recognition. AutoVideo is featured for 1) highly modular and extendable infrastructure following the standard pipeline language, 2) an exhaustive list of primitives for pipeline construction, 3) data-driven tuners to save the efforts of pipeline tuning, and 4) easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI). AutoVideo is released under MIT license at https://github.com/datamllab/autovideo

## [862] Text/Speech-Driven Full-Body Animation

**Authors**: *Wenlin Zhuang, Jinwei Qi, Peng Zhang, Bang Zhang, Ping Tan*

**Conference**: *ijcai 2022*

**URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/863](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2022/863)

**Abstract**:

Due to the increasing demand in films and games, synthesizing 3D avatar animation has attracted much attention recently. In this work, we present a production-ready text/speech-driven full-body animation synthesis system. Given the text and corresponding speech, our system synthesizes face and body animations simultaneously, which are then skinned and rendered to obtain a video stream output. We adopt a learning-based approach for synthesizing facial animation and a graph-based approach to animate the body, which generates  high-quality avatar animation efficiently and robustly. Our results demonstrate the generated avatar animations are realistic, diverse and highly text/speech-correlated.
