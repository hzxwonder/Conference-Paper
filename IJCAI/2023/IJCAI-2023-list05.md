        **Abstract**:

        First-order model counting (FOMC) is the task of counting models of a first-order logic sentence over a given set of domain elements. Its weighted variant, WFOMC, generalizes FOMC by assigning weights to the models and has many applications in statistical relational learning. More than ten years of research by various authors has led to identification of non-trivial classes of WFOMC problems that can be solved in time polynomial in the number of domain elements. In this paper, we describe recent works on WFOMC and the related problem of weighted first-order model sampling (WFOMS). We also discuss possible applications of WFOMC and WFOMS within statistical relational learning and beyond, e.g., automated solving of problems from enumerative combinatorics and elementary probability theory. Finally, we mention research problems that still need to be tackled in order to make applications of these methods really practical more broadly.

        **Abstract**:

        The advent of large language models (LLMs) has brought about a revolution in the development of tailored machine learning models and sparked debates on redefining data requirements. The automation facilitated by the training and implementation of LLMs has led to discussions and aspirations that human-level labeling interventions may no longer hold the same level of importance as in the era of supervised learning.
This paper presents compelling arguments supporting the ongoing relevance of human-labeled data in the era of LLMs.

        **Abstract**:

        AI Generated Content (AIGC) has received tremendous attention within the past few years, with content ranging from image, text, to audio, video, etc. Meanwhile, AIGC has become a double-edged sword and recently received much criticism regarding its responsible usage. In this article, we focus on three main concerns that may hinder the healthy development and deployment of AIGC in practice, including risks from privacy; bias, toxicity, misinformation; and intellectual property (IP). By documenting known and potential risks, as well as any possible misuse scenarios of AIGC, the aim is to sound the alarm of potential risks and misuse, help society to eliminate obstacles, and promote the more ethical and secure deployment of AIGC.

        **Abstract**:

        Robots for minimally-invasive surgery such as steerable needles and concentric-tube robots have the potential to dramatically alter the way common medical procedures are performed. They can decrease patient-recovery time, speed healing and reduce scarring. However, manually controlling such devices is highly un-intuitive and automatic planning methods are in need. For the automation of such medical procedures to be clinically accepted, it is critical from a patient care, safety, and regulatory perspective to certify the correctness and effectiveness of the motion-planning algorithms involved in procedure automation. In this paper, I survey recent and ongoing work where  we develop efficient and effective planning capabilities for medical robots that provide provable guarantees on various planner attributes as well as introduce new and exciting  research opportunities in the field.

        **Abstract**:

        When planning the tasks of some physical entities that need to perform actions in the world (e.g., a Robot) it is necessary to take into account quite complex models for ensuring that the  plan is actually executable. Indeed the state of these systems evolves according to potentially non-linear dynamics where interdependent discrete and continuous changes happen over the entire course of the task. Systems of this kind are typically compactly represented in planning using languages mixing propositional logic and mathematics. However, these languages are still poorly understood and exploited. What are the difficulties for planning in these settings? How can we build systems that can scale up over realistically sized problems? What are the domains which can benefit from these languages? This short paper shows the main two ingredients that are needed to build a heuristic search planner, outline the main impact that such techniques have on application, and provide some open challenges. These models and relative planners hold the promise to deliver explainable AI solutions that do not rely on large amounts of data.

        **Abstract**:

        Designing provably fair decision-making algorithms is a task of growing interest and importance. In this article, I argue that preference-based notions of fairness proposed decades ago in the economics literature and subsequently explored in-depth within computer science (specifically, within the field of computational social choice) are aptly suited for a wide range of modern decision-making systems, from conference peer review to recommender systems to participatory budgeting.

        **Abstract**:

        This survey    overviews  a new  research agenda on the  economics of machine learning, pursued at the Strategic IntelliGence for Machine Agent (SIGMA) Lab  at UChicago.  This overall research agenda has two themes:  machine learning for economics and, conversely, economics for machine learning (ML). The first theme focuses on designing and analyzing ML algorithms for economic problems, ranging from foundational economic models to influential real-world applications such as recommender systems and national security. The second theme  employs economic principles to study  machine learning itself, such as the valuation and pricing of data, information and ML models, and designing incentive  mechanisms to improve large-scale ML research peer reviews.  While   our research focuses primarily on developing methodologies,  in each theme we  also highlight  some real-world impacts of these works, including ongoing large-scale live experiments and potential deployments for various applications.

        **Abstract**:

        Over recent decades, sequential decision-making tasks are mostly tackled with expert systems and reinforcement learning. However, these methods are still incapable of being generalizable enough to solve new tasks at a low cost. In this article, we discuss a novel paradigm that leverages Transformer-based sequence models to tackle decision-making tasks, named large decision models. Starting from offline reinforcement learning scenarios, early attempts demonstrate that sequential modeling methods can be applied to train an effective policy given sufficient expert trajectories. When the sequence model goes large, its generalization ability over a variety of tasks and fast adaptation to new tasks has been observed, which is highly potential to enable the agent to achieve artificial general intelligence for sequential decision-making in the near future.

        **Abstract**:

        My PhD research deals with the use of Liquid Democracy (LD) for social choice scenarios, while considering the scarcity of attention as a driving factor. My aim is to better understand LD: theoretically as well as practically; in particular, by establishing containment in certain computational classes for corresponding combinatorial problems, suggesting methods to improve the use of LD, and understand its adaptation to specific scenarios. Concretely, I consider the use of LD as a solution for the problem of low voter attention in light of the high cognitive effort needed by voters to actively participate in voting processes.

        **Abstract**:

        Deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained huge attention over the last several years due to their promising results in various tasks. However, due to their large model size and over-parameterization, they are recognized as being computationally demanding. Therefore, deep learning models are not well-suited to applications with limited computational resources and battery life. Current solutions to reduce computation costs mainly focus on inference efficiency while being resource-intensive during training. This Ph.D. research aims to address these challenges by developing cost-effective neural networks that can achieve decent performance on various complex tasks using minimum computational resources during training and inference of the network.

        **Abstract**:

        While many forms of belief change exist, the relationship between belief revision and human reasoning is of primary interest in this work. The theory of belief revision extends classical two-valued logic with an approach to resolve the conflict between a set of beliefs and newly learned information. The goal of this project is to test how humans revise conflicting beliefs. Experiments are proposed in which human subjects are required to resolve conflicting beliefs via relevance and confidence. In our analysis, the human responses will be evaluated against the predictions of two perspectives of propositional belief revision: formal and psychological.

        **Abstract**:

        The growing population has accelerated the process of urbanisation, and is putting under stress the urban transport infrastructure. This results in increased traffic congestion, with significant health, economy, and social issues. 
    Artificial Intelligence techniques are increasingly demonstrating their capabilities in predicting and supporting urban traffic control, by extending the abilities of traffic authorities in planning and reacting to different traffic conditions. In this context, our main research topic fits in the autonomic traffic control theme, with the aim of supporting the design of autonomous traffic control systems.

        **Abstract**:

        Sequential decision making is an important field in machine learning, encompassing techniques such as online optimization, structured bandits, and reinforcement learning, which have numerous applications such as recommendation systems, online advertising, conversational agents, and robot learning. However, two key challenges face real-world sequential decision making: the need for adaptable models and the need for safety during both learning and execution. Adaptability refers to the ability of a model to quickly adapt to new and diverse environments, which is especially challenging in environments where feedback is sparse. To address this challenge, we propose using meta reinforcement learning with sub-optimal demonstration data. Safety is also critical in real-world sequential decision making. A model that adheres to safety requirements can avoid dangerous outcomes and ensure the safety of humans and other agents in the environment. We propose an approach based on online convex optimization that ensures safety at every time step. Addressing these challenges can lead to the development of more robust, safe, and adaptable AI systems that can perform a wide range of tasks and operate in a variety of environments.

In this case, we need to decide which information is reliable and should be taken into account. We want to define measures of reliability for each source that provides information, but also to find the truth among the conflicting information, and propose properties of these measures.

        **Abstract**:

        The last decades have witnessed significant progress in machine learning with a host of applications of algorithmic decision-making in different safety-critical domains, such as medical, law, education, and transportation. In high-stake domains, machine learning predictions have far-reaching consequences on the end-users. With the aim of applying machine learning for societal goods, there have been increasing efforts to regulate machine learning by imposing interpretability, fairness, robustness, etc. in predictions. Towards responsible and trustworthy machine learning, we propose two research themes in our dissertation research: interpretability and fairness of machine learning classifiers. In particular, we design algorithms to learn interpretable rule-based classifiers, formally verify fairness, and explain the sources of unfairness. Prior approaches to these problems are often limited by scalability, accuracy, or both. To overcome these limitations, we closely integrate automated reasoning, formal methods, and statistics with fairness and interpretability to develop scalable and accurate solutions.

        **Abstract**:

        My thesis consists of investigating how chest X-ray images, radiologists' eye movements and patients' clinical data can be used to teach a machine how radiologists read and classify images with the goal of creating human-centric AI architectures that can (1) capture radiologists' search behavioural patterns using their eye-movements in order to improve classification in DL systems, and (2) automatically detect lesions in medical images using clinical data and eye tracking data. Heterogeneous data sources such as chest X-rays, radiologists' eye movements, and patients' clinical data can contribute to novel multimodal DL architectures that, instead of learning directly from images' pixels, will learn human classification patterns encoded in both the eye movements of the images' regions and patients' medical history. In addition to a quantitative evaluation, I plan to conduct questionnaires with expert radiologists to understand the effectiveness of the proposed multimodal DL architecture.

        **URL**: [https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2023/818](https://doi.org/10.24963/ijcai.2023/818)

        **Abstract**:

        Multilingual Intent Detection and explore its different characteristics are major field of study for last few years. But, detection of intention dynamics from text or voice, especially in the Indian multilingual contexts, is a challenging task. So, my first research question is on intent detection and then I work on the application in Indian Multilingual Healthcare scenario. Speech dialogue systems are designed by a pre-defined set of intents to perform user specified tasks. Newer intentions may surface
over time that call for retraining. However, the newer intents may not be explicitly announced and need to be inferred dynamically.
Hence, here are two crucial jobs: (a) recognizing newly emergent intents; and (b) annotating the data of the new intents in order
to effectively retrain the underlying classifier. The tasks become specially challenging when a large number of new intents emerge
simultaneously and there is a limited budget of manual annotation. We develop MNID (Multiple Novel Intent Detection), a cluster
based framework that can identify multiple novel intents while optimized human annotation cost. Empirical findings on numerous
benchmark datasets (of varying sizes) show that MNID surpasses the baseline approaches in terms of accuracy and F1-score by wisely allocating the budget for annotation. We apply intent detection approach on different domains in Indian multilingual scenarios -
healthcare, finance etc. The creation of advanced NLU healthcare systems is threatened by the lack of data and technology constraints for resource-poor languages in developing nations like India. We evaluate the current state of several cutting-edge language models used in the healthcare with the goal of detecting query intents and corresponding entities. We conduct comprehensive trials on a 
number of models different realistic contexts, and we investigate the practical relevance depending on budget and the availability of
data on English.

        **Abstract**:

        Causal reasoning reflects how humans perceive events in the world and establish relationships among them, identifying some as causes and others as effects. Causal discovery is about agreeing on these relationships and drawing them as a causal graph.
Argumentation is the way humans reason systematically about an idea: the medium we use to exchange opinions, to get to know and trust each other and possibly agree on controversial matters. 
Developing AI which can argue with humans about causality would allow us to understand and validate the analysis of the AI and would allow the AI to bring evidence for or against humans' prior knowledge.
This is the goal of this project: to develop a novel scientific paradigm of interactive causal discovery and train AI to recognise causes and effects by debating, with humans, the results of different statistical methods

        **Abstract**:

        Although state-of-the-art hierarchical robot planning algorithms allow robots to efficiently compute long-horizon motion plans for achieving user desired tasks, these methods typically rely upon environment-dependent state and action abstractions that need to be hand-designed by experts. On the other hand, non-hierarchical robot planning approaches fail to compute solutions for complex tasks that require reasoning over a long horizon. My research addresses these problems by proposing an approach for learning abstractions and developing hierarchical planners that efficiently use learned abstractions to boost robot planning performance and provide strong guarantees of reliability.

        **Abstract**:

        The availability of a large amount of unstructured text has generated interest in utilizing it for future decision-making and developing strategies in various critical domains. Despite some progress, automatically generating accurate reasoning models from the raw text is still an active area of research. Furthermore, most proposed approaches focus on a specific do-main. As such, their suggested transformation methods are usually unreliable when applied to other domains. This research aims to develop a framework, SCANER (Semi-automated CAusal Network Extraction from Raw text), to convert raw text into Causal Bayesian Networks (CBNs). The framework will then be employed in various domains to demonstrate its utilization as a decision-support tool. The preliminary experiments have focused on three domains: political narratives, food insecurity, and medical sciences. The future focus is on developing BNs from political narratives and modifying them through various methods to reduce the level of aggressiveness or extremity in the narratives without causing conflict among the masses or countries.

Working towards ethical and transparent automated content moderation (ACM), my goal is to find where it is still relevant to implement linguistic expertise. I show that transparent statistical models based on linguistic knowledge can still be competitive, while linguistic features have many other useful applications.

        **Abstract**:

        The vast diversity of internal designs of taskable black-box AI systems and their nuanced zones of safe functionality make it difficult for a layperson to use them without unintended side effects. The focus of my dissertation is to develop paradigms that would enable a user to assess and understand the limits of an AI system's safe operability. We develop a personalized AI assessment module that lets an AI system execute instruction sequences in simulators and answer queries about these executions. Our results show that such a primitive query-response capability is sufficient to efficiently derive a user-interpretable model of the system's capabilities in fully observable settings.

        Participatory budgeting (PB) is an implementation of direct democracy that allows members of a community to make collective budgeting decisions. However, existing PB processes rely upon a pre-defined central budget. We introduce a framework for pooling resources in addition to selecting projects, which we call PB with Resource Pooling. We motivate the key characteristics of this model and the basic properties we would like a mechanism to satisfy. We summarize results and discuss interesting questions related to our framework.

        **Abstract**:

        Although object detection has achieved impressive progress and has a broad impact, it still encounters significant challenges in accurately detecting objects in open-world scenarios. The data in real-world open scenes often exhibit characteristics of limited annotations, such as very few annotated samples or even unknown classes with no annotations. Our studies mainly focus on applying detection to various open scenes and addressing the challenges of sparse samples and unknown classes. The comprehensive research aims to develop more powerful and efficient methods for object detection in the open world, making them more suitable for real-world applications.

        **Abstract**:

        Careful choice of feature transformations in a dataset can help predictive model performance, data understanding and data exploration. However, finding useful features is a challenge, and while recent Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) systems provide some limited automation for feature engineering or data exploration, it is still mostly done by humans. We demonstrate a system called SemFORMS (Semantic Transforms), which attempts to mine useful expressions for a dataset from access to a repository of code that may target the same dataset/similar dataset.  In many enterprises, numerous data scientists often work on the same or similar datasets, but are largely unaware of each other's work.  SemFORMS finds appropriate code from such a repository, and normalizes the code to be an actionable transform that can prepended into any AutoML pipeline.  We demonstrate SemFORMS operating over example datasets from the OpenML benchmarks where it sometimes leads to significant improvements in AutoML performance.

        **Abstract**:

        Machine Learning (ML) systems are increasingly being adopted to make decisions that might have a significant impact on people's lives. Because these decision-making systems rely on data-driven learning, the risk is that they will systematically propagate the bias embedded in the data. To prevent harmful consequences, it is essential to comprehend how and where bias is introduced and possibly how to mitigate it. We demonstrate Bias on Demand, a framework to generate synthetic datasets with different types of bias, which is available as an open-source toolkit and as a pip package. We include a demo of our proposed synthetic data generator, in which we illustrate experiments on different scenarios to showcase the interconnection between biases and their effect on performance and fairness evaluations. We encourage readers to explore the full paper for a more detailed analysis.

        **Abstract**:

        There is a growing interest in the use of AI techniques for urban traffic control, with a particular focus on traffic signal optimisation. Model-based approaches such as planning demonstrated to be capable of dealing in real-time with unexpected or unusual traffic conditions, as well as with the usual traffic patterns. Further, the knowledge models on which such techniques rely to generate traffic signal strategies are in fact simulation models of traffic, hence can be used by traffic authorities to test and compare different approaches.

In this work, we present a framework that relies on automated planning to generate and simulate traffic signal strategies in a urban region. To demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we consider real-world data collected from sensors deployed in a major corridor of the Kirklees region of the United Kingdom.

        Markov Logic Networks (MLN) are used for reasoning on uncertain and inconsistent temporal data. We proposed the TMLN (Temporal Markov Logic Network) which extends them with sorts/types, weights on rules and facts, and various temporal consistencies. The NeoMaPy framework integrates it as a knowledge graph based on conflict graphs which offers flexibility for reasoning with parametric Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inferences, efficiency with an optimistic heuristic and interactive graph visualization for results explanation.

        **Abstract**:

        This work presents an active software instrument allowing deep learning architects to interactively inspect neural network models' output behavior from user-manipulated values in any latent layer. Latent Inspector offers multiple dimension reduction techniques to visualize the model's high dimensional latent layer output in human-perceptible, two-dimensional plots. The system is implemented with Node.js front end for interactive user input and Python back end for interacting with the model. By utilizing a general and modular architecture, our proposed solution dynamically adapts to a versatile range of models and data structures. Compared to already existing tools, our asynchronous approach of separating the training process from the inspection offers additional possibilities, such as interactive data generation, by actively working with the model instead of visualizing training logs. Overall, Latent Inspector demonstrates the possibilities as well as the appearing limits for providing a generalized, tool-based concept for enhancing model insight in terms of explainable and transparent AI.

        **Abstract**:

        Formal verification of intelligent agents is often computationally infeasible due to state-space explosion.
We present a tool for reducing the impact of the explosion by means of state abstraction that is (a) easy to use and understand by non-experts, and (b) agent-based in the sense that it operates on a modular representation of the system, rather than on its huge explicit state model.

        **Abstract**:

        Deep learning methods are well suited for data analysis in several domains, but application is often limited by technical entry barriers and the availability of large annotated datasets. We present an interactive machine learning tool for annotating passive acoustic monitoring datasets created for wildlife monitoring, which are time-consuming and costly to annotate manually. The tool, designed as a web application, consists of an interactive user interface implementing a human-in-the-loop workflow. Class label annotations provided manually as bounding boxes drawn over a spectrogram are consumed by a deep generative model (DGM) that learns a low-dimensional representation of the input data, as well as the available class labels. The learned low-dimensional representation is displayed as an interactive interface element, where new bounding boxes can be efficiently generated by the user with lasso-selection; alternatively, the DGM can propose new, automatically generated bounding boxes on demand. The user can accept, edit, or reject annotations suggested by the model, thus owning final judgement. Generated annotations can be used to fine-tune the underlying model, thus closing the loop. Investigations of the prediction accuracy and first empirical experiments show promising results on an artificial data set, laying the ground for application to a real life scenario.

        **Abstract**:

        Graph neural networks are widely used in machine learning applied to chemistry, and in particular for material science discovery. For crystalline materials, however, generating graph-based representation from geometrical information for neural networks is not a trivial task. The periodicity of crystalline needs efficient implementations to be processed in real-time under a massively parallel environment. With the aim of training graph-based generative models of new material discovery, we propose an efficient tool to generate cutoff graphs and k-nearest-neighbours graphs of periodic structures within GPU optimization. We provide pyMatGraph a Pytorch-compatible framework to generate graphs in real-time during the training of neural network architecture. Our tool can update a graph of a structure, making generative models able to update the geometry and process the updated graph during the forward propagation on the GPU side. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/aklipf/mat-graph.

        **Abstract**:

        We present a novel recommendation system designed to provide real-time treatment strategies to therapists during psychotherapy sessions. Our system utilizes a turn-level rating mechanism that forecasts the therapeutic outcome by calculating a similarity score between the profound representation of a scoring inventory and the patient's current spoken sentence. By transcribing and segmenting the continuous audio stream into patient and therapist turns, our system conducts immediate evaluation of their therapeutic working alliance. The resulting dialogue pairs, along with their computed working alliance ratings, are then utilized in a deep reinforcement learning recommendation system. In this system, the sessions are treated as users, while the topics are treated as items. To showcase the system's effectiveness, we not only evaluate its performance using an existing dataset of psychotherapy sessions but also demonstrate its practicality through a web app. Through this demo, we aim to provide a tangible and engaging experience of our recommendation system in action.

        **Abstract**:

        This paper presents Fedstellar, a platform for training decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models in heterogeneous topologies in terms of the number of federation participants and their connections. Fedstellar allows users to build custom topologies, enabling them to control the aggregation of model parameters in a decentralized manner. The platform offers a Web application for creating, managing, and connecting nodes to ensure data privacy and provides tools to measure, monitor, and analyze the performance of the nodes. The paper describes the functionalities of Fedstellar and its potential applications. To demonstrate the applicability of the platform, different use cases are presented in which decentralized, semi-decentralized, and centralized architectures are compared in terms of model performance, convergence time, and network overhead when collaboratively classifying hand-written digits using the MNIST dataset.

        **Abstract**:

        Plansformer is a novel tool that utilizes a fine-tuned language model based on transformer architecture to generate symbolic plans. Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that have been shown to be highly effective in a range of natural language processing tasks. Unlike traditional planning systems that use heuristic-based search strategies, Plansformer is fine-tuned on specific classical planning domains to generate high-quality plans that are both fluent and feasible. Plansformer takes the domain and problem files as input (in PDDL) and outputs a sequence of actions that can be executed to solve the problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Plansformer on a variety of benchmark problems and provide both qualitative and quantitative results obtained during our evaluation, including its limitations. Plansformer has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of planning in various domains, from logistics and scheduling to natural language processing and human-computer interaction. In addition, we provide public access to Plansformer via a website as well as an API endpoint; this enables other researchers to utilize our tool for planning and execution.

        **Abstract**:

        Creating a piece of music is difficult for people who have never been trained to compose. We present an automatic music generation system to lower the threshold of creating music. The system takes the user's humming as input and creates full music based on the humming melody.  The system consists of five modules: 1) humming transcription, 2) melody generation, 3) broken chord generation, 4) accompaniment generation, and 5) audio synthesis. The first module transcribes the user's humming audio to a score, and then the melody generation module composes a complete melody based on the user's humming melody. After that, the third module will generate a broken chord track to accompany the full melody, and the fourth module will create more accompanying tracks. Finally, the audio synthesis module mixes all the tracks to generate the music. Through the user experiment, our system can generate high-quality music with natural expression based on the user's humming input.

        **Abstract**:

        There is an increasing demand to design policy interventions to achieve various targets specified by the UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. Designing interventions is a complex task given that the system may often respond in unexpected ways to a given intervention. This could be due to interventions towards a given target, affecting other unrelated variables, and/or interventions leading to acute disparities in nearby geographic areas. In order to address such issues, we propose a novel concept called Stress Modeling that analyzes the holistic impact of a policy intervention by taking into account the interactions within a system, after the intervention. The simulation is based on the postulate that complex systems of interacting entities tend to settle down into "low energy'' configurations by minimizing differentials in capabilities of neighbouring entities. The simulation shows how policy impact percolates through geospatial boundaries over time and can be applied at any granularity. The theory and the corresponding package have been explained along with a case study analyzing a fertilizer policy in the Agro-climatic Zones of the state of Karnataka, India.

        **Abstract**:

        This paper presents a novel system, named LingGe ("伶歌" in Chinese), to generate songs for ancient Chinese poems automatically. LingGe takes the poem as the lyric, composes music conditioned on the lyric, and finally outputs a full song including the singing and the accompaniment. It consists of four modules: rhythm recognition, melody generation, accompaniment generation, and audio synthesis. Firstly, the rhythm recognition module analyzes the song structure and rhythm according to the poem. Secondly, the melody generation module assembles the rhythm into the template and then generates the melody. Thirdly, the accompaniment generation module predicts the accompaniment in harmony with the melody. Finally, the audio synthesis module generates singing and accompaniment audio and then mixes them to obtain songs. The results show that LingGe can generate high-quality and expressive songs for ancient Chinese poems, both in harmony and rhythm.

        **Abstract**:

        Automated machine learning (AutoML) has been widely researched and adopted for supervised problems, but progress in unsupervised settings has been limited. We propose `"LOTUS", a novel framework to automate outlier detection based on meta-learning. Our premise is that the selection of the optimal outlier detection technique depends on the inherent properties of the data distribution. We leverage optimal transport to find the dataset with the most similar underlying distribution, and then apply the outlier detection techniques that proved to work best for that data distribution. We evaluate the robustness of our framework and find that it outperforms all state-of-the-art automated outlier detection tools. This approach can also be easily generalized to automate other unsupervised settings.

        **Abstract**:

        To free human from laborious video production, this paper proposes the building of VideoMaster, a multimodal system equipped with four capabilities: highlight extraction, video describing, video dubbing and video editing. It extracts interesting episodes from long game videos, generates subtitles for each episode, reads the subtitles through synthesized speech, and finally re-creates a better short video through video editing. Notably, VideoMaster takes a combination of deep learning and traditional computer vision techniques to extract highlights with fine-to-coarse labels, utilizes a novel framework named PCSG-v (probabilistic context sensitive grammar for video) for video description generation, and imitates a target speaker's voice to read the description. To the best of our knowledge, VideoMaster is the first multimedia system that can automatically produce product-level micro-videos without heavy human annotation.

        **Abstract**:

        Image matting is a fundamental technique in visual understanding and has become one of the most significant capabilities in mobile phones. Despite the development of mobile storage and computing power, achieving diverse mobile Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) applications remains a great challenge. To address this issue, we present an innovative demonstration of an automatic system called "Matting Moments" that enables automatic image editing based on matting models in different scenarios. Coupled with accurate and refined matting subjects, our system provides visual element editing abilities and backend services for distribution and recommendation that respond to emotional expressions. Our system comprises three components: 1) photo content structuring, 2) data-driven matting engine, and 3) AIGC functions for generation, which automatically achieve diverse photo beautification in the gallery. This system offers a unified framework that guides consumers to obtain intelligent recommendations with beautifully generated contents, helping them enjoy the moments and memories of their present life.

        The explosive popularity of smart manufacturing has caught the attention of researchers in terms of intelligent mold processing and management. Machining mold components is a crucial step in the mold production process for many industries, which creates (e.g., cutting, drilling, and shaping a metal) the individual parts (e.g., core pins, ejector pins, cavities, slides, and lifters) that make up a mold used in manufacturing. We present IMPsys, an AI-based system that automatically explores machining jobs, infers their processing time and schedules them on machines, given numerous 3D modelling files of mold components. Our demo video can be found at: http://bit.ly/3EeKnyL.
